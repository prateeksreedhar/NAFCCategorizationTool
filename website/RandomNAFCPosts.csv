When in H.S I met a girl and it wasn't long on finding out why we were the only 2 sitting out swimming class and we became friends. I was on track team, she played on the tennis team. She used to hide the diapers while playing tennis with pantyhose and rhumba tennis briefs (rows of lace on back). It didnt matter because everyone else were wearing the same ruffled panties and nobody noticed my friend was wearing diapers. You dont see the fashion anymore, wish that ruffles would make a comeback.
Anyway she graduated college and moved away. I have dated girls that did not wear them and because I wear them it just doesn't seem as comfortable a relationship as me being with someone similar. Maybe the girl for me is a Square Dance Girl with Depend's . I dont know how to square dance at this point but am willing to learn.
I figure its better to be honest now than to be disrespectful and surprise you with it later....and who knows maybe we will meet and live happily ever after!
For anyone who has the Jerry Springer mindset. You should know that lots of people wear them in a polite respectful society. It appears that they sell them at all the stores. Tell my previous girlfriends, one who wore them do to birth defect and the other girl wore them due to pregnancy issue from previous relationship. Mine came after motorcycle accident, I healed 100% but wear them ""just in case"" Concerning the ruffles, Years ago the fashion was ruffles, ruffles under tennis and square dance skirts, under sundresses or with just a sweatshirt. I just wish the style would come back! I loved it! Im sorry you all took everything wtong but you are in the 99%..hence the embarrassment.

Oxybutnin makes urge incontinence worse for me. 
My pessary helps. It has stopped in between dribbles completely.
Biofeedback does help. In a few short sessions you can learn to lower your blood pressure so that your kidney function is better which is part of this, gain muscle control for in between toilet trips, and learn to relax away stress causing more natural release while on the throne which can reduce urge surges.
An OMRI TENS massaging unit from the local 24/hour drugstore and probably available online placed externally on the anterior over the bladder turned on low between trips helps hold and tone in between visits to the toilet. 
No caffeine and sip instead of whole glass all at once fluid intake.
Timed two hour toilet trips or immediately after my afternoon fluid intake which I monitor to prevent urge surges and
when on the throne turn off OMRI, turn on faucet, a heat pack placed anteriorly over the abdominal area to help relax instead of stressing about going to the bathroom and deep breathing exercises while on the throne help to release then double void because some will drop after the first release and then cath for releasing residual urine. 

Interstim is out for me due to a lower back muscle injury and hips that are an inch difference in height plus head injuries.

Disposables (use only the most absorbent) will ""plump"" up when wet but they are handy while out and about.  I use a cloth snap on diaper cover when I wear disposables.  It does make it bulkier but they help with leaks.",0,1,Adult diapers
4,4,NO,"Thu, Dec  17 '15 at 4:00PM EST",nvbob,"I've had bed wetting problems since I was 14 and that was back when they didn't have disposables.   I was able to use Birdseye cloth 21 X 40 pin on diapers with Gerber Toddler size slip on pants until I was 16.   Of course the doctors thought it was a phase and I would grow out of it sooner or later.   

At 16 I had to start purchasing diapers from the Sears Catalog, and medical supply stores.  That was the first time I had to deal with the issue outside of the house other than the doctors office.  At that age, I was mortified to walk into a medical supply store and ask for diapers.   The one person that helped me the most was a middle aged lady that worked at the medical supply store in San Jose, CA.   She told me I should consider myself lucky that I didn't have to wear them full time like many of her customers.   It did help to know that I was not the only one, but there was also other younger people that had continence problems.

When I turned 19 and I had not grown out of it, I moved to another state, got a job, and started a new life.   Being on your own for the first time in a new place is stressful, and I had to work 6 and 7 days a week to pay for rent and a car.   After 5 years of dealing with night problems, it became the norm for me.  I actually got up the nerve to call a diaper service to see if they had anything for adults.  At that time disposables were still not available, and I found out I could get adult diapers delivered to my apartment.   Very cheap, no more laundry, and they even supplied a diaper pail. They did not supply plastic pants, but they did laundry them.

Acceptance is a gradual thing.   Anyone new to incontinence issues, the one piece of advice is be patient it gets easier.

Skipping forward to now (many years), I began to have problems during the day.   That scared the heck out of me.   No longer an in house issue to deal with, it had invaded my life.  After many trips to the doctor, visits to a Urologist, they decided to do a urodynamic study may help with the determining the cause, and hopefully finding a solution.

It was the most embarrassing doctors visit ever.   I won't go into details, but after removing a disposable diaper in front of a female technician, they inserted catheters and wires all over.  

The results demonstrated that I had a low capacity bladder with uninhibited bladder contractions.  One medication after another and some with side effects that were not pleasant.

I have been using diapers full time for the last 3 years.  I sympathize with anyone new to incontinence, as it has been a life changing event.   However, the good news is that it has gotten much easier. I have learned to deal with all aspects of it; even the most difficult issues like carrying a special computer bag (my diaper bag), changing in public restrooms, and even the occasional situation where my diaper is accidentally exposed (the most horrifying).

I order my products online now, and I am very thankful for several reasons.   First they are a ton of great products out there.  Disposables that are safe, cloth and high quality plastic pants, but the one thing that did the most good was talking to one of the sales people at one of the leading adult cloth diaper stores.  She said, you are lucky, you only have urinary problems.  

Acceptance is a great thing. It has taken years, but I am no longer embarrassed about incontinence and wearing diapers.  I sure as heck don't advertise it or bring it up in everyday conversations with people.   I will say that I have become very comfortable wearing diapers, and I am very pleased that I can afford the best products and for the most part, not many have any clue that I am diapered day and night.

I did not mean to rant, but I hope some of the experiences I have spoke about might possibly help the person that has been tossed into situation where they need to wear diapers.

A few years ago, my urologist tried me on six different drugs for urge incontinenc, one drag after another for six months on each drug. None of them had much effect on my incontinece, and five of them caused unpleasant side effects. After that, I decided to give up on meds and just be happy in diapers.

I prefer diapers, but another possible solution for a man is an external catheter, with a condomlike thing that adheres to the penis and a tube connected to a bag strapped to the leg. I have tried such devices; and as I said, I much prefer diapers. However, many men use external catheters and swear by them. It's an alternative you might want to consider.",0,1,Adult diapers

My dad lives in a skilled nursing facility, suffers from dementia, congestive heart failure  and has a lot of knee pain from arthritis, so standing is often not an option for him anymore.Incontinence became an issue after surgery for colo-rectal cancer, and then the dementia also made it worse. (Up many times a night to use the bathroom.)

Incontinence has a great impact on Dad's quality of life because he becomes agitated when aides attempt personal cares on him. He also has ""sundowning"" behavior, where his night and day can become mixed up, so he doesn't sleep well at night.

One thing about living in a nursing home when you have complete incontinence, is that the night shift will wake you to check if you need a change before they go off shift, in the interest of protecting your skin from rashes.

My question (finally!)is: is there a diaper or product that is super-absorbent enough for overnight use, that would wick away the moisture from the skin so you can wear it a little longer (and not have to be wakened from a deep sleep, which triggers agitation?)

Also, are you aware of any easier product to use for overnight (from a changing standpoint) than the traditional side-tab diapers? Getting him to roll to the side when he's sleepy and agitated doesn't make for a good experience.

I would appreciate any suggestions anyone might have. Thanks so much for sharing.",0,1,advice to help a parent

Although she usually knows when she has to urinate or defecate, it is not practical or easy to attend to her immediate needs. Therefore, diapers are used.

I was horrified last weekend to observe that the cleanser being used daily is the ""liquid soap"" that is found in the bathroom dispenser of the nursing home. Although my mother has never suffered from any kind of skin rashes before and has never had any skin blistering, this has been an ongoing concern at this particular facility.

My sense is that the ""soap"" that is being used to clean her is actually too strong for her skin and is causing dryness and itching. 

I need advice on what kind of cleanser to purchase for her care so that the caregivers can clean her personal areas well without causing skin break-downs.  I know that there are many products available at drug stores, etc. I just do not know which one may be best.

When I was initially diagnosed with this condition, I was depressed but soon realised that you just have to get on with life (this was ten years ago). Then eight years ago I found a catheter available that had a water sachet incorporated into the catheter. This avoided the problem of filling the catheter `in view` when using public toilets. I have been under the care of my GP. The system has worked so well that I am now almost unaware of the problem. I simply rang my pharmacist and the 12 boxes of catheters would turn up on my doorstep three days later. So, it came as a terrible shock to me that the above board sent me a letter (I got this 9/7) it was dated 5/7 and stated that I could not be prescribed these catheters any more from the 4/7!! (no consultation, no warning) from my GP but had to go through a `continent sevice`. This applies to everyone that requires any kind of device i.e colostomy bags etc.) I am very, very worried about this situation. I tried to ring the service on Friday and despite leaving three messages during the pm, had no return call. I`m worried that my prescription will change, I don`t know what provisions have been made for my personal holiday periods, or national holiday periods like Christmas. There seems be no emergency procedure if the prescription gets lost. I just don`t know how people wo are working are going to cope. Has anyone got any experience of this type of system?

Someone please correct me if this is wrong but I heard second hand that Canada's (free) healthcase limits patients to one catheter per year?  But don't worry!  There are new studies that show UTIs are no more significant using clean techniques the reusing the same one over and over.  

           - - - Diatribe starts here - - -
In the USA this national plan for healthcare is sort of taking off but getting it to even operate is 90% of the challange we face.   *Technical things like not charging 10x more for out of network services that they tell us (Through webpages written by dolts) Doctors / clinics are in network then out then in depending on variables that should make no difference.  This works out great if you were doing this to increase the number of people who need to seek mental health services.  I know its worked on me!!!

This might be paranoid (Not a mental health issue of mine) but I think  anyplace with (or going in the direction of) national Healthcare is going to have more and more excuses to not pay for medical supplies, drugs or services.   I think based on a number of things that have been happening we can enjoy large numbers of new and different ""studies"" that prove you don't need this or that or the other thing.  Cancer diagnosis?  Don't worry.  Some cancers grow slow and surely something else will kill you first so lets ignore it and count on ""watchful waiting""   Whoever invented that term clearly doesn't know how busy doctors are with their 15 minute visits where they spend 14 of them typing on a computer.   

Taking some kind of drug?  I predict that more and more drugs will have sketchy studies published that show the drug is either found to ""do nothing"" or more likely be shown to cause ill effects so your better off not taking it.

In the UK isin't it difficult to ever see your primary care doctor in a reasonable time frame?  If your need CT scans or something along that line is it true you spend months waiting? Perhapes they are hopeing you show up dead before the appointment comes up.

As patients / citizens but most importantly voters I think we need to come up with a solution that has a focus on the actual healthcare and not Insurance company Profit Margins or Iron fisted Government control.  Returning the power to the Patient / Doctor connection would be nice but who can even imagine that anymore?  

There is a great movie on Netflix that shows what an ER room does now versus how it worked before.  Hint...  If you came in with a serious injury you had a mass of people rushing in and workling like a well oiled machine trying to save your life.  Now you have a mass of hours waiting for someone to come out and fill out forms so you can see a doctor and fill out more forms.

Just out or morbid curiousity I looked at the first hundred Fortune 500 companies.   Did you know that 18 of them are either insurance or drug making / selling companies?    12 of the 18 show increased profit margins.   Which I read as making a higher percentage of profit.   This is not my area but seems fishy to me.  A friend from the old Soviet Union where Insurance companies were not in fashion equated insurance with gambling.   If a casino showed increased odds in their favor?  What would that say about the Casino?

And as far as drugs go I think its a little like one ""mob"" against another ""mob""    Have you ever considered how many new drugs are simply old drugs modified ever so slightly so they can be patented again and again?  Has anyone ever done a study on things like Beta Blockers or any class of drugs to see if there has been anything actually improved over the different iterations?

I see it as one side showing how the ""new improved"" drug is better AND 100x more expensive and the other side is showing how the drugs of that type are not needed at all *Or dangerous.  It seems like in both ways we the patients are being screwed.",0,1,ANEURIN BEVAN CONTINENCE SYSTEM

I have bladder issues during both the day and night. At night the only thing that gets me a good nights sleep is a fitted brief. During the day, my voiding issues aren't as bad and I can get by with the pullup style underwear. Abena makes very absorbent products, and the new Tena Overnight underwear are decent for daytime use. They are both very discreet.

That said, no one can tell you are wearing an incontinence product. I have had to wear them for over a decade now, and I've never had someone say something or caught anyone staring. The rustle of a product isn't noticeable once you have clothes on, and the only person that would take notice of ""diaper butt"" is someone that either has a similar issue. Anything you read on the internet about someone noticing or commenting on another persons choice of diaper is likely internet fan fiction at it's worse.

I find briefs (diapers) the best solution to manage my incontinence in general, as they are reliable, and there aren't any tubes or bags to manage. When I am active, i.e. I play sports or run or hike, they can become a problem because they can start to chafe. If I play tennis for 2 or 3 hours, then briefs work well as long as I choose thinner briefs. But if I go for a run, even as short as a 30 minute run, or if I go hiking, then there is a heightened risk of chafing. I don't always get chafing, but if I do it quickly becomes a problem during a hike, painful, especially if I still have hours to go until my destination. I have had bad experienced with indwelling catheters when running, so try to avoid having them in when being active.

I imagine that external catheters are best suited for situation where I move a lot, such as running or hiking. But I have never gotten comfortable with them. I tried the ""Men's Liberty"" and it gave me more confidence. What do you guys do? What do you use when being active? Pads, briefs, condom catheters? What kinds of condom catheters do you use when being active? Long, short, glue-on, Men's Liberty...? What kinds of bags? Calf, thigh, hip, large, small...?

Just be supportive.  It's not her fault, it's not ""child like"" or ""baby like"".  Rather it's responsible adult management of a medical issue.  Diapers aren't just for babies, they make them for adults for a reason.  Washing sheets all the time is a pain and unnecessary.  Focus on stressing to her the practical benefits and downplay all of the embarrassing aspects of it.  

I'm trying to convince myself of all of this too but I know it's all true.  We're just so conditioned from out toilet training days that accidents are shameful.  I think parents these days employ more positive methods of toilet training but when I was little shame was a big motivator (are you a big boy or a baby?  Wetting the bed is for babies.

Definitely wait about an hour after taking the Imipramine to go to sleep as it seems to take a while to kick in.

You sound much more understanding than my parents ever were which is great! I definitely would say have her get some type of night time protection just in case.

He stated that he had accidents in front of other people, referenced changing his diaper and even played football with his diaper showing.  What he stated was that no one seemed to care.

Junior high and high school were miserable for me.  I have mild cerebral palsy and was a little socially delayed, so in other words i had a target on my back.
College was a completely different world.  The first thing i noticed was open and accepting people were about everything.  Everyone was focused on people treating each other respectfully and kindly, and people who would engage in bullying behavior tended to be ostracized by the group as a whole. No one seemed to be targeting anyone.  I did go to a smaller school, where there was only one dorm of about 100 people.  I was on friendly terms with all of them.

The Peristeen Anal plug is a simple, safe and discreet aid for faecal incontinence. It prevents the uncontrolled loss of solid stool. Because of its small size, the anal plug can easily fit into your pocket or handbag. It cannot be seen by others as it is worn inside the body.

Unpleasant odours are also avoided as the plug retains stool in the bowels.

The anal plug is inserted just like a suppository. The foam has been compressed to a small size and coated with a water-soluble film. When the film is exposed to the warmth and moisture of the rectum, it dissolves – the plug then expands, conforming to the shape of the rectal cavity. By protecting against leakage, the anal plug gives you the confidence to participate in activities where you need to feel secure, such as swimming.

Peristeen anal plug
•Is made from soft and comfortable foam that retains it softness in use.
•Comes in two sizes – small and large
•Is easily removed by pulling the soft gauze string attached to the plug
•Can be left in for up for 12 hours",1,1,Coloplast Peristeen rectal incontinence plug

I have to get him up after 6 hours max to go pee, then layer him back up.
There is no adult diaper or any other product that on its own will keep his bedding dry.  The absorbent material on the front and back of every diaper I have tried or have seen online does not extend far enough out into the tabs.  No liner or pad, no matter how many ounces it can absorb, can contain all of the urine he passes in his sleep, because the absorbent material on the back of the body at the top of products cannot absorb its share of fluid.  The fronts of the two innermost layers get maxed out, then the urine flows out the sides.  So the 27.5 oz TopLiner works in the front, fluid flows through to the next layer, and then out the sides into the 'wings' (Tena Guards) that I stick on the diaper, and sometimes into the diaper itself.

The problem I found was, even though I would apply a skin prep (made by Smith and Nephew), they would be very difficult to remove after being on all day.  (I sleep in Depend pull ups.)  I had noticed an obscure post saying that the original Coloplast Freedom Clear without Aloe were much easier to remove.  So, I went online and found some without Aloe, ordered them, and they are much much better, I will say they are 50 times better for me, as the ones with Also would sometimes take me nearly a hour to remove and clear up all the sticky adhesive on my penis, and on my hands.  I still use the Skin Prep in the morning and let it dry, before putting the condom catheter on.  Then, when I remove it at night, it rolls right off, dry with no adhesive getting on my fingers.

I use a leg bag and tubing by Hollister that fits on the inside of my leg between the knee and ankle.  The tubing can be cut to length with scissors, and it's soft, light and flexible.  The bags come with a wide (1 inch I think) straps that do a great job of holding the bag in place.)  To drain the bag, I go to a toilet, raise the seat and flip the lever on the valve down 90 degrees to open.  It's a 15-20 second operation.

I am in this state because a urologist here in NC apparently did something wrong last March during a GreenLight procedure to reduce the median lobe (BPH).  It left me so incontinent that if I'm standing or walking, the bladder drains totally. So a pullup/diaper is really wet in no time at all. I flush the bag at night, wash the tubing with a bit of alcohol and hang it to dry overnight.

This is SO annoying.  Most doctors try to steer you away from diapers.  I guess they feel like they've failed if you end up in diapers.  My urologist put me on pills.  I tried 7 or 8 OAB meds and nothing worked.  Either the side effects were insufferable or the medicine had little if any effect on my bedwetting.  My OAB had continued to progress as the doctor even acknowledged was likely and I now have accidents all the time.  If you don't want me to wear a diaper, and your pills don't work WTF DO you want me to do?  Stay inside at home for the rest of my life?  

Sorry, but I also prefer the way diapers feel to the way those gross medications made me feel.  I HATE that I'm a 36 year old who has to wear diapers, don't get me wrong, but I'll take the diapers over those meds any day.  

For a doctor to suggest wearing diapers is not ""manly"" is extremely unprofessional.  I'd seek a new doctor. When my doctor told me ""I'd prefer you didn't use diapers"" I simply replied ""I'd prefer not waking up soaked in urine and soaking my wife in urine"".  I think he kind of got it, but I know he still doesn't like it.  I stopped seeing him anyway as I don't feel like there's much hope for me.

I have to self cath. This is new to me it's just been three and a half weeks since I have had to learn this.

I was sexually molested by several different men before I was eighteen years old. I grew up ashamed of my body because I was young and didn't understand why this kept happening to me. I blamed myself. Thankfully I do not feel this way today.

I didn't have my first pelvic exam until I was 26.  I have not had any kids partly because I didn't want a bunch of doctors to see my vagina or poke around in there.

Now I have a serious urologic problem. A large percent of urologists are men(including mine but he is a great kind doctor and I am comfortable with him). Pelvic exams are very painful sometimes. Sex is painful.

I hate having to cath its uncomfortable and painful at times.
I also have a mild stricture of my urethra. In the process of experimenting(learning) with caths to find the best one for me my urethra has become swollen and painful at times. This combined with the stricture means pushing a catheter through a closed down, swollen, and bleeding urethra.

This is all very hard to live with and except.

Your childhood and adolescence must have been difficult indeed.  You have my condolence, and my hope that life will improve for you.  Incontinence and the need to self-catheterize are never easy.  The problem is that, in order for doctors to learn what your problem is, they need to examine you, order some tests, and treat you, perhaps clean out the urethral stricture which seems to be causing you so much trouble.

As far as whether you are sleeping alone being a factor, that's very likely related to how much you trust your environment, and deeply you're sleeping as a result.  To wake for the bathroom, the things need to happen: your brain needs to receive a signal that your bladder is full, your brain needs to delay the micturation reflex (which is that adults normally do until they reach a toilet), and your brain needs to rouse you from sleep before you reach the point where the micturation reflex activates involuntarily.  If any of those mechanisms break down, you pee without waking up.",0,1,Curious

Off and on for years I have had the occasional accident in my sleep. Normally I would write it off to a dream of using the restroom in the woods, etc. These incidents were really far apart, some for as much as 7 or 8 years(I am 54) and they were always isolated events. About 6 months ago I had the regular dream and voided in the bed.

About 2 weeks ago had another accident. This one however, was followed by several more on successive nights. 6 nights and only one dry.

I have been to my dr who was not helpful at all with the exception of making referral to urologist which will take nearly two weeks to hear back from my insurance and then who knows how long until an appt may be made. So I am looking t maybe 4-6 weeks sleeping in diap until then.

I would like to run this by you as a potential culprit. When I was 20 I was involved in a motorcycle accident and broke/fractured 3 lumbar vertebrae and have serious issues with coccyx pain ever since. Could it be possible for this issue to be a major factor in my latest struggles. I have read that Coccyx injuries and the lumbar vertebrae can affect both enuresis (urine incontinence) and fecal incontinence.

Of course the issue continues. One strange and seemingly unheard of caveat is the fecal/bowel involvement. Here is what happens, I wake up to find myself pushing/straining to empty bowels.

Any suggestions as to why this is happening to me, both the bedwetting and the bowel elimination, please feel free to share.

My wife has been phenomenal through all this and makes me realize just how much I really do love her and how much I need her. She has been understanding and sympathetic and brings up things I would have not thought of--like an emergency bag with change of clothes and a diaper in case of an accident or being stranded on the road.

Any way, she is my right hand, my heart.

An ABENA M4 or any or the new REARZ series of disposable briefs PLUS the addition of Abena's best 7"" by 24"" booster should be up to the task.  Two of those boosters are do-able, but would be uncomfortably bulky by SAP expansion in short order.  

Now, an earlier answer for you came from VestalM* about the use of a good 'overpant'.   Did you try this?  That would help contain leaks at the tops and leg openings of your brief.  Yes, a number of us do use these...plastic / vinyl / rubber pants as you could call them and they work.  Since you do not wet at night, you really would not have to go to a full 'bloomer' style that I use at times.  

Other than disposables, some with heavy and sudden voids say there is nothing more effective than cloth diapers.  That may be an unpopular solution...but they DO have that unique quality for taking on large, sudden gushes.  And with cloth, you would have to add vinyl or rubber pants over the cloth.

If you can't find it, this is VestalM's response to you from a few weeks ago...please read it again:

I too have urge flooding problems. Also having major night time issues. I have found that some diapers are definitely better than others at handling the rate and quantity that is happening. Some can even handle multiple floods if necessary before requiring a change. I am kind of new to all this and have certainly not tried everything on the market. However, Some that I have had success with include Abriform XPlus L4 (soft), Molicare Super Plus (plastic), Seni Quattro (soft), Confidry 24/7 (plastic), NorthShore Premium (plastic), and Rearz (plastic). Each of these are different thickness and absorbancy and fit and discreetness. Each is excellent for different reasons and having them all gives you me options for different situations. 

Another option is to try diaper covers over the briefs. I like several types that work very well (incl but not limited to Gary Wear and Leakmaster). I hope that you can find a product (or products) that works better for you to help you handle your situation better and get you back to feeling more comfortable and confident. Good luck.

The answer is NO! I gush!!! And not just a few hundred cc's. My bladder is so large my average void is between 800-1200 cc's at a time. Because of my condition, I don't get the sensations of it filling until it gets so full, it spasms and with all the pressure I don't have a snowballs chance in hell of holding it. And once it starts, it doesn't stop until I am empty, so the ""maximum absorbency"" of most diapers on the market is an absolute joke! What do the consider maximum? 100, 200 cc's. The only way I can feel good that I am protected is to wear two heavy booster pads stuffed in a tape on diaper. The problem with that is, if I do make it to the bathroom and untape  them to go in the urinal, They don't re-seal.

Since joining this board I came across a number of others that seem to be doing the same.

I'd like to understand what others are doing exactly and why. For how long have you been doing it? What has been your experience?

Speaking to my experience: I use indwelling catheters as little as possible, as I am worried about short term (UTI, urethral irritation) and long term effects (bladder cancer, stenosis). So when the cramping is bearable then I wear diapers or pads to manage leaking. But when the cramping gets too bad then I put in an indwelling catheter, sometimes for a few days, and sometimes for a week or two. This has been a good management approach for me for the past 2 or 3 years. It was not something that any of my doctors suggested. It's really something I figured out on my own. My doctors warned me about long term effects but ultimately let me make the choices that work best for me.

As far as the urinary frequency I have been using Foley catheters. Foley catheters are not a perfect solution but it has been the best thing for me for over 2 1/2 years now. I began to have urinary issues in February/March 2014. In June of 2014 they got so bad I ended up in the ER getting a foley inserted. I was given a prescription shortly thereafter and have been using them ever since. I work usually 3 day stretches and have a series of days off. When I am off my wife, who is an ER nurse puts a foley in me so I can give my bladder a rest and sleep through the night. I also need a foley for any car rides more than 45 minutes or any other time we won't be near a bathroom. I wear diapers 24/7 even over the foley. I found it catches small leaks/discharge and provides the best support for me so my equipment isn't banging around.

Yes...we may 'experience or manage' this.  To say that suffering from enuresis / incontinence somehow indicates we can do nothing about it or even that pain is involved.  

The word 'suffering' tends to elicit pity for us or relegation to a near sub-culture status...an exclusionary term that seeks to set us aside as societal outcasts.   Bah!

Assuredly we are NOT that.  We take control, we stay in touch,
and continue to seek solutions, better products, support from others here and we even welcome a touch of humor in the process.  Imagine that!

Take a negative (the 'suffering') and turn it to a positive. 

We continue to seek better ways to manage.

I do feel happy that you have found this forum and have decided to tell us about yourself.  Those were important steps to help you find a treatment or accommodation to your enuresis (bed wetting) condition.  There are many here who will offer support and good information.  Please read through many of the post in this forum over the past few years and you will learn a lot.

I can only think of the many others world-wide in similar situations who may never reach out for support and medical treatment.  That is indeed so sad that they will continue to feel alone, especially in the early years of life.

The national flag by your name indicates you are from Africa (Nigeria), so you probably learned 'British English'.  I'm sure we probably have a few members here from the UK, but in most cases the translations of our U.S.A. terms and expressions will come clear on their own and we will understand your idioms.

I was already married when this became a problem so I can't pretend to know what it's like to date with this issue.  I wear diapers to bed and my wife is very understanding of it.  Married or not, it was SO embarrassing for me when the time came to start wearing diapers.  But it is what it is.  Life goes on.  I'm getting quite used to it now.  Maybe I'll beat it one day, maybe I'll be in diapers forever.  Whatever.

If you meet a person, think of your bedwetting as a good litmus test.  If someone can't accept you for you, including your faults and imperfections, then they're NOT the right person for you anyway.  MOST adults can accept things like this.  The ones who can't arent' worth your time.  While it's SO hard to be open about this, let someone see you in a diaper, it makes you feel so vulnerable.  Vulnerability is NOT something I'm very used to as a man but I can honestly tell you I think it's made my wife and I MORE intimate (not sexually intimate but emotional closeness).  

You only have one life.  DON'T let incontinence define you or be the overriding factor that determines your life.  Once I accepted that I needed diapers and started waking up in a dry bed, it was a huge weight lifted off.  While I'd never tell lots of people, I'm not incredibly ashamed anymore.  I buy my night time diapers online but I buy depends mens pullups at the local gocery store of pharmacy.  The first time I bought them I was humiliated.  Now I could care less.

When my problems started about 5 years ago, he did end up finding out when I was watching him and his brother for a week while their dad was away.  He was curious as he never thought a guy in their 20's would need to wear diapers.  He told me his older brother used to be a “diaper boy” too (he wore at night until 8 or 9, which I already knew).  After that, it rarely came up and he never thought any less of me.  His dad was away a lot and he liked that I was the one that stayed with them.

He had some problems at home for the last few years, so I agreed to let him live with me during his senior year of high school.  Everything works out well and he still rarely makes comments about it and never with any malice.  The only thing that still makes me feel uneasy is when he has friends over.

 I don't think this would have much impact. It didn't effect my sons toilet training. Long term I worry about it causing difficulty with peers. But in all honesty, if kids want to tease or bully him, they will find any excuse to do it. Also if I model being confident in diapers, it may help him to be more confident and accepting of himself.  I also think it will help him to have more empathy for individuals with disabilities and be able to see them as more then a disability. 

2. How will it affect my relationship with my child

If you have a positive relationship with your child, provide love, care, support and consistency, and attention, it won't matter whether you are in a diaper or not.  They will love you for everything else you do. 


3. How will it affect how my child sees me. 
I think my son will see this as only part of who I am not the whole me. He will know the kind part, the smartass, the geek, and as his father. I think how your son sees you is going to go way beyond whether or not you wear diapers.

 I went to a urogynecologist in New York City by the name of Dr. Kavener. She did not recommend medicine, but told me to needs to train my bladder. No luck!
I went to another urogynocolgist in New Jersey & he prescribed I think it's called Mytrobec, something like that, but after paying $150.00 for the prescription, I rad the contraindications and it's dangerous.

I took meds as a child but my mom stopped me from taking them, she didn't want me to become dependent. My mom used to scream at me, and get angry. That didnt help at all, I used to feel like a loser. Never really going to sleepovers. Some nights are better than others, but it's a problem that needed to be addressed. I found a dr in my area and had a urine dynamics test done. It turns out that I have sensitive nerves, that causes me to use the bathroom constantly. I was prescribed meds, and will soon start taking them. Hopefully this will end the bedwetting and the constant running to the bathroom. It took alot of encouragement from my fiancé,  to finally see a dr. And now I feel somewhat relived that it's something that can be fixed. If there's any advice that I could give to anyone, is to go to a specialist.

At least I can apply the OAB label to it and that takes some of the shame I've been feeling away.  However I'm really frustrated by the world and medical community turning a blind eye to urinary incontinence in younger men.

I can find a million blogs, articles, etc on OAB in women.  I can find a lot of info on OAB due to prostate in older men.  But what about people like me?  It's like we don't even exist.  My urologist told me I'd be surprised by how many men my age have similar issues who, like me, have perfectly fine prostates.  So what gives?  WHY do I have OAB?  I can't find ANYTHING on the internet exploring OAB.  Almost every single info source just slaps the ""prostate"" reason on mens continence problems and then moves on.  If it's not the prostate then apparently I've been in a traumatic accident and suffered spinal injury, or have MS or Parkinsons or other nerve damage.....Except NONE of those apply to me.

Any website that talks about OAB will have 80% of the content focused on women and a blurb about men, and again often older men.  It's so frustrating.

103,3,NO,"Tue, Aug  9 '16 at 11:01AM EDT",MikeJames,"My ""diagnosis"" was pretty much the doctor saying my symptoms check most of the boxes for OAB.  Urodynamics was inconclusive.  I don't always have urgency and leakage, it's only sometimes.  Often my bladder fills slowly and the urge comes on gradually and I can hold it for hours.  Other times the urge is sudden and extreme and I can hold it for minutes.  This is pretty uncommon but does happen.  The amount leaked is usually not a lot.  I've started wearing Tena men's guards for my subway commute just in case.  At home and in the office I feel like I can get to a bathroom in time, and have never leaked there.  My primary complaint is bedwetting which is getting more and more common.  

First thing the doctor said was ""prostate"" but the digital exam confirmed mine is not enlarged and the PSA results came back normal.  

I have early type 2 diabetes and he said diabetic nerve damnage can cause incontinence but he thought that was a long shot since my blood sugar isn't that high and my diabetes is new.  Very unlikely that I already have any diabetic nerve damage.  So at the end of the day I think labeling it ""OAB"" was the best fit.  

I have a crappy high deductible health plan and live in a very expensive (but very high quality - Boston) healthcare market.  I don't even want to see the bill I'm going to get for all of this.  He wants me to try exercises, lifestyle changes etc and then possibly OAB meds and if necessary repeat all this testing in 6 months.

I went to a surgeon who thought it was BPH but... I got that feeling from him that I got from the first dude that this was something being mailed in so I went back to the PA to ask for advice.  She was quite clear that I ought to insist on a biopsy before assuming I had BPH so...  I did and it was positive so I went from BPH to cancer surgery.  Anyway - long story about finding a doctor (or PA) that you think knows what they are doing and aren't too bored with your problem.

One thing I could've done better, is be more up front about what was really going on.  I tiptoed around my accidents, talking mostly about urgency and things like that.

In one visit I had a digital rectal exam, urinalysis, blood work, cystoscopy and urodynamics.  Cleared for bladder and prostate cancer which was the most important finding for me.  I guess I'm just disappointed that the urodynamics wasn't able to reproduce my symptoms and lead to a more definitive diagnosis.  I misspoke if I suggested the doc mailed it in.  He was actually very thorough and approached everything very matter of factly like all this testing is no big deal.  I was as comfortable as I think I could be under the circumstances with him.  I could never have gotten through that day with a female doctor!  But that's just me haha.

After everything I've been reading about OAB which has included all the junk medical sites, to better sites like this, to peer reviewed journal articles, all I can come up with is OAB is a symptom complex with varying and often unknown causes.  I think I'm just frustrated by that.  I think I want a known cause.  It's frustrating that the majority of web content for OAB focuses on women and what does focus on men just assumes prostate issues.  It leaves me feeling like I'm a case that is slipping through the cracks.  

What I really do like about this doctor is his conservative approach.  He wants me to try exercises, times voiding, diet and exercise (which I'm already working on due to the diabetes), keeping a journal etc for a month or so and then on the follow up we'll talk about stacking a med onto the treatment plan.  He says he likes to try things like this first to see if there's any, even little, improvement before adding meds.

The causes MAY be different for some cases.  While it DOES state that for men it's usually due to BPH, it's not always.  Recent research suggests a paradigm shift based on an acknowledgement that while men have almost ALWAYS been treated first for Bladder Outlet Obstruction (BOO) due to enlarged prostate, MANY never saw results and that when these men start being treated instead for Detrusor Overactivity (DO), they see better results.  This came from a peer reviewed journal article I just read.  It said essentially that doctors need to STOP ASSUMING the prostate is the cause and instead LISTEN TO THE PATIENT to see if DO is more likely the problem.  It suggested that aside from the prostate, urinary plumbing between men and women is not all that different and therefore it's reasonable to assume that Detrusor Overactivity can certainly be the primary cause in MANY men.

My prostate came back just fine.  PSA normal, size was normal with digital exam.  I have NO signs of obstruction (difficulty starting stream, stream stops and starts, post void dribbling) and even my urologist initially suggested the prostate.  It wasn't until I spoke up and said doc, I really do not have voiding trouble AT ALL, I have urgency and leaks and I wet the bed.  I don't believe my prostate is the issue unless my PSA comes back bad or you tell me my prostate is huge.

I suppose, some make the implication that since a person with incontinence has 'lost control' of bladder and / or bowels, then it must be tied to some other loss of control we have chosen to exert over our lives.

I have traveled A LOT since becoming incontinent. It can be tough and I have even had a few bad encounters at the airport. The best advice I can give is this. 
- Give yourself extra time - You want to prepare for security to be jerks. 95% of the time if you opt for the pat down and explain quietly to them that you are wearing protection for medical reasons they will simply pat you down and send you on your way. 
- Be clean right before you go through security - If you change and are dry right before you head through security, there is less chance of scanners or people picking up on any liquids, foreign objects, etc.
- Ask someone for if there is a family restroom anywhere. These are normally single use and you are able to be alone and change privately. (If not, I normally find the emptiest part of the airport and change in those bathrooms. Least amount of people)
- Be prepared - Make sure you are carrying on you AT LEAST three changes. That way if there is an issue with the flight getting delayed or anything you have something ready.
- Wear the best products - when it comes to traveling, don't skip out for the cheap stuff. Get a heavy absorbent product and be ready to wear it. (this of course is for those that can't make it to a restroom at all. IF you can, wear whats comfortable)
I wrote an article about a bad experience as well. 
Ultimately, be mentally prepared for there to be one. I am not saying be worried or sure something bad will happen, but just be ready for someone to embarrass you. That way if it happens you can handle it with calm dignity rather than breaking down or lashing out.

Last month was the first time I had been selected for a body scan and as expected I was asked to step aside for a pat down.  I was definately nervous, but had gone through this scenario a couple times in my head.  I was determined to be honest and confident.  I mentioned to the agent before he started that I was incontinent and he would notice my protection.  He said OK and went about the pat down.  Clearly confirming the presence of a diaper and not just a pad or pull-up he asked if he could talk to me for a moment.  He asked me if I had a change in my carry on.  When I said I did he asked if he could confirm that and I would be all set.  I told him my supplies were in my backpack so we went to the post screening table and I opened my backpack and he looked in confirming two fresh diapers and a pack of wipes.  He thanked me and appologized for the intrusion.  

I could tell this was clearly an experienced agent.  I doubt many others would be that discreet, so again Archer's advice to prepare for some embarassment, but keeping your cool, is sound advice.

I've done quite enough flying in my lifetime, thank you.   In more recent (my much less rushed years), I've opted for travel by train (love it), until a few years ago, on my Harley, and then the good old standby, my four-wheeler.  I love the freedom, privacy and the slower paced ways of these methods.  The train experience can be highly social...the bike and car offer the solitude I'm not afraid to seek, either.

Quite frankly, I just don't like to involve strangers or the general public in my incontinence needs and management techniques.  I'd prefer that none are the wiser.  Conversely, I'm quite willing to offer support, information and the humor of my experiences while managing my own personal issues.  You are the people who understand, who need to know, and who 'get it'.  We can share here in this 'stigma free zone.'

The Airpremiums are a great product from Northshore.  It is as comfy as the supremes without as much bulk.

They barely fit...the tapes only come to the side and not the front.  They are really thin and not very absorbent.  They were rated at 6 drops out of 10.  I figured if the old school molicare super plus were a 10, this would still be a decently absorbent diaper.  False.",0,1,Good cloth covered diaper?

I decided to wear diapers when it got to be a 3+ times per week issue but planned that to only be temporary. Then i started having daytime urgency and eventually started having a few daytime accidents. Went from guards to pullups to diapers 24/7. I was diagnosed with OAB.  I had the whole slew of urology tests done, tried a bunch of meds. Tried kegels and bladder training and other behavioral modifications but had no real success. I may consider discussing surgical options but i needed a break from the poking and prodding. 

Im so used to wearing diapers to bed that honestly the bedwetting isnt a big deal to me anymore.  My wife is very supportive and accepting.  Diapers allow me to manage it very well. I HATE having to wear diapers during the day but theyre better than wet pants. 

I definitely get the reluctance to give in to diapers. See a urologist and get a diagnosis and go from there. LOTS of people get a fix whether its meds or surgery and the successful people tend not to hang around boards like this so dont think its hopeless for you based on our lack of success. Worst case if yours only stays as a night time problem is wearing diapers to bed. Trust me that you can get used to that and live a very normal life. Even being in diapers 247, i live quite normally.

One additional suggestion.  The caths that come self lubricated at 10x better then the ones you dab gel on.  It keeps them fully lubricated so there are no dry spots to scrape the urethera.  Also be on the lookout for polished eyelits.  The openings that go into the bladder should be as smooth as possible.

I'm sorry that you are struggling with this issue. I'm newly having incontinence issues (both day and night) myself.

Yes...but:  A diaper is not a cure for this condition.  At the same time, do seek to see a doctor or medical professional in the field of urology, for example.  Some countries, like the UK, might even refer you to a 'continence nurse'.

The diaper will be a start to simply keep the bed dry and allow you a good rest overnight ---

It may very well be curable.  Diapers should be an interim management tool and a last resort if treatments don't work.  

I have idiopathic overactive bladder.  I've tried a handful of pills, none are working well enough to outweigh the side effects but everyone is different.  I'll keep trying new meds.  If diapers become permanent for me then I think I can cope with it but if I were you I'd make sure to see a doctor before just resigning to diapers.

Adult onset bedwetting is often the sign of an underlying medical condition.  You need to get checked out.  IF it's always been a problem since childhood, it may not be caused by a serious medical problem but may still be treatable and beatable.",2,1,I am tired

I have had issues with dribbling in the past, then I had a complete loss of urinary continence. I was soaking my entire pants and in order to go to work I had to wear diapers. I was leaking in the cheap walmart type diapers but it was much more manageable than no protection. I tried the pads at first but I went through those like 1 an hour. 
I went to the urologist and he checked my prostate. This was so very uncomfortable. When he hit it with his fingers I about jumped off the table in pain. He diagnosed me with prostates and an antibiotic. Well I had also purchased a clamp for my leaking by then. I ended up regaining control, and ending my prescription early. 
Well recently I lost control again. I am back on cypro and I am very depressed. I know my wife is strong and she is sticking it out with me. I am very blessed. I feel like I am robbing her. I feel very little self value and I know all of that is untrue. I just can't hold urine. That does not change who I am. I am who God created me to be, I do however wish to regain control. I am WAY to young to go through this. I am going to go back to the urologist, but I am so scared of the prostate check, and the news. I guess I just continue to muddle through this.

I am a member of a prostate cancer support group here in Maine. We regularly hear from men with incontinence problems, since that can be one side effect of prostate cancer treatment.
First I would say I think you have a poor urologist. I would try a different one if possible.
Here are some possible solutions:

One of our men successfully used a drug that his urologist prescribed for him, called oxybutynin chloride, 5 mg. tablet, one per day, to reduce incontinence.  Check the side effects of using this.

On the Internet, go to www.arcusmedical.com and search for ""AFEX"" urine collection system. It collects it in a bag on your leg.

Also Google proact therapy for the treatment of stress incontinence in males. These were being tried out in clinical trials, last I knew.

Another urine collection system is seen at www.bioderm.us/  It is a bit different from the Afex system.  Either one would probably keep you dry. Cleanliness is important to avoid urinary tract infections.

Regarding use of a clamp, doctors warn that it should only be used for short periods of time, to avoid damage to the skin and underlying tissues. Take it off every 30 minutes and then reapply as needed.

Check into use of Kegel exercises, which some claim help to control incontinence.

Keep in mind there are 3 types of urinary incontinence:
STRESS incontinence - leaking of urine when you cough, sneeze, or do hard work or are active.
OVERFLOW incontinence - the bladder is not getting emptied properly due to a blockage somewhere in the urinary system.
URGE incontinence - a feeling that you have to constantly have to go to the bathroom right away or you will burst, cause by an oversensitive bladder.

When all else fails, there are several surgical operations that can be done, such as the Artificial Sphincter, or Advance sling. 
Google ""Male Incontinence Solutions"".

16,15,NO,"Tue, May  31 '16 at 3:19PM EDT",jaredc3,"Hi Youngactiveman. So much good advice here. I too wondered if stopping the antibiotic early resulted in a resurgence of the same infection that originally caused you bladder issues. MS is indeed a very scary possibility, and could be a military career ender. However, I would strongly recommend getting checked out by your doctor, and (with sincere respect for kenedmunds) recommend telling your doctor everything. We can all attest to how embarrassing it can be to discuss incontinence with your doctor, but remember that they are professionals and have seen it all. Military docs included. AND, your doc can't do his or her job effectively without all of the information. Even if you think a symptom can't be related to what's going on, it is important that you tell your doc. They know stuff the rest of us dont know, and they can't put all the pieces together if they are missing pieces. It might not be MS! It might be something else entirely, but they will have a more challenging time figuring that out without all of the information. 

I know this may not be terribly comforting, but if your condition would require separation from the military, it should be rated as service-connected, which could help relieve some of the financial burdens that would otherwise come from separation. The bureaucracy is daunting for sure, but you can do it!

The fear, secrecy, ignorance (on the part of medical providers) and stigma and shame surrounding it is a crime. There are so many proactive solutions, mostly revolving around doctors better preparing their patients by setting realistic expectations, and offering nonsurgical options and treatments before performing radical surgeries. Any solution takes time, fostering of and encouraging support systems, and having a positive, open and flexible attitude is always helpful. 

Additionally, I myself suffer from uterine fibroids and relate with the struggle for discrete options to stay dry, but instead of urine my situation involves blood. Like a crime scene amount. Disposable undergarments (sorry but diapers are for babies and I'm an adult) have been a literal life, sanity and job saver. 

Finding a good urologist, and not being afraid to ""shop around"" until you do, and researching surgical options (before any type of surgery), makes all the difference in quality of life.

If you have not seen a dermatologist, I recommend you do so. If the rash is a yeast infection, you might need other creams, such as Ketoconzole 2% and maybe a powder, like Nystatin Topical.

I (Totally) understand his reluctance to go under the knife again.  That was one of the options I heard about but my Uro person saw my reaction and cut the instructional lecture short.  One thing you didn't mention that would keep him dry and not have to keep changing pads is to use a condom catheter.  I tried this and I think if my current solution didn't work as well as it does this would be my second choice.

I would have him ask his Urologist if he could go in to learn how that works and possibly get samples (If Available) or at least a prescription so he can ask for some samples from the manufacturer.  I would get a variety of sizes because the size is important so its comfortable and works right.  If he does give it a shot make sure to tell him I think he should give it a long enough trial before he gives it a thumbs up or down.  All of this stuff.  Cathing or whatever seems to become easier and less ""weird"" with practice.

Here is a link that talks about how this works and how it differs from using pads and absorbents.

I'm not sure what level of incontinence you are living with but presuming that it is primarily bladder related, I'd suggest considering a two-piece system for those times that you are biking or reffing soccer.
There are larger pads that can provide more than enough absorption and these type of pads can be worn with a fixation pant (a robust washable mesh pant).
This approach provides the absolute highest level of breathability possible when addressing bladder incontinence and, provided that you select the right pad, you can enjoy the level of confidence needed to live life fearlessly.
I'm a little biased on this one, but I'd suggest one of the Abri-San pads from Abena and one of the Abri-Fix Super fixation pants.

I'm 36, a wife and a mother of a 7yr old. I too, have been dealing with the same thing. When I was a teenager, I was in a car accident that broke 16 of my bones along with organ damage to my kidney's, liver and both lungs. 3 of the bones broken were my 3rd, 4th & 5th lumbar vertebrae. The 3rdL was completely crushed. I also developed a seizure disorder from the head injury. I was in a full body brace in a hospital bed for over 4 months. During that time I had a catheter in. When they finally took it for good, I was completely urinary incontinent. That REALLY sucked. I had to retrain my bladder, and that took about a year to happen. That was a pretty rough year as a teenager. Afterwards, I rarely had any problems, thankfully.
In my late 20's, my nerves went crazy with severe pain and I couldn't hardly move. I ended up having surgery on my spine to seperate some pinched nerves and they said that I have disc degeneration, sciatica, and a bunch of other stuff wrong that all stemmed from my initial injury. Since then, I've had fairly frequent wetting accidents both day and almost every night. We weren't sure if it was the seizures or the nerve damage or just both. My pride didn't allow me to do anything about it (as far as regular protection goes) until it began to disrupt my plans in life. About 3 months ago my bladder began to completely drain itself without my permission each time I stood up or rolled over in bed. It's no longer just a 'splash' here and there. It's like dumping out a bucket. I rarely feel an urge to go anymore, I only feel myself getting drenched. I don't have a choice anymore about wearing a diaper around the clock. It sucks. My skin is suffering and it's so time consuming to manage. I feel like all I do is worry about leaking, changing, restricting fluids, timing everything out, always planning ahead, ect. I have changed my entire wardrobe to accommodate my bottom half being covered (and I love fashion). That's just my life now and I'm still mortified about it. It feels so exhausting. It's nice to vent in a place where others understand. No one else really 'gets it' unless they have experienced it too. 
So just know that you aren't alone. There are MANY of us out here that are in the same boat. It can be a lonely condition, so I'm really thankful to have a place to discuss it.",1,1,Incontinent after back surgery

If you read my intro you will see that I am derelict in my ability to stay dry at night.  This has been happening for about 8 months now and I am dealing with it as many of you, with protection--Northshore briefs are my diaper of choice.

I do have some questions for all of you regarding a reusable underwear for day time issues, light to moderate leakage after voiding bladder.  On occasion have missed making it to restroom but have mostly been able to muscle through to avoid full bladder release.  

What I see out there are Salk, Everwear, Peteys, etc.  Could those of you who have experience with any of these please chime in and let me know your thoughts.  I am not in any way restricted to the above mentioned brands.  In fact other brands would be interesting to peruse.  I really just want a non-drama pair of underwear that will help with excessive leakage after using restroom that will fit and be durable.

Any thoughts??

Thanks in advance for any input and for ya;;'s willingness to share which has helped me tremendously in my own struggles with my bladder.

Having to wear diapers, especially as I got into my teens, very nearly destroyed my self-esteem and it took me many years to get over the shame and put that away.  Now fast forward to today, 50 years later...

I have in recent years developed an enlarged prostate (BPH) and have had to go back to wearing diapers due to incontinence, particularly at night but not only.  Ugh; the memories this situation brought back were not good. (I will be having a prostate biopsy later this week to determine whether there is cancer present and, if so, how aggressive and whether it has begun to spread. Ugh again.)

So here's my point and my advice:  I got over my boyhood shame and low self-esteem issues because of my teen bedwetting once I understood that it was NOT my fault.  Despite my initial reaction to once again wetting the bed - and having to wear diapers, once again - it only took me a much shorter time to come to the same conclusion:  this situation is NOT my fault, either.  (Thanks, btw, to others here who helped me remember that.  It was very helpful!)

Ask yourself this:  If a problem develops with your eyesight due to a medical problem would you be embarrassed to wear glasses or contacts?  No.  If If you broke your arm would you be ashamed to wear a cast?  No.  If you had to wear, or use, any other device or aid due to almost any other medical issue would you be ashamed?  Most likely not.

You have a medical condition and it is not your fault.  There are ways to manage this condition.  One way is wearing diapers.  Another way is waking up in a wet bed and wetting your clothes while awake in the daytime.  Which is the better choice?  I think you know.

Thank you for contacting the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Contact Center regarding Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) screening for passengers using specific personal hygiene products.

Sanitary napkins, panty liners, and adult diapers may appear as an anomaly on AIT monitors during screening.  If an item does result in an anomaly, the individual will be referred for additional screening, including a patdown of the area(s) of the body that resulted in the anomaly.  

If passengers are screened using a patdown, it is important to know the following:

•	A private screening will be offered if the patdown involves sensitive areas.
•	Patdowns will be conducted by a TSO of the same gender.
•	Passengers may ask for private screening at any time.
•	A companion may be present during the private patdown screening with the TSO or other TSA employee, and this companion will be rescreened when the patdown is completed.

When I was in my early 40's I had a strange thing happen in my pelvic floor region. The Dr. called it ""Levator Ani Syndrone"". My pelvic muscles would go into spasm when I stood up and my legs wouldn't support me and I would fall. I was bedridden for at least 3 months with this and it was extremely difficult to have a bowel movement or urinate. I was on muscle relaxers, IB prophen, and supositories for months daily. I finally got to the point where I could walk without the spasms and continued on with my life. Since then, I always have had a soreness in that area, especially when trying to ride a bike. Now that I'm trying to do Kegels, it has made the area very sore and almost prone to not be able to do them. Any suggestions because I'm leaking quite a lot, usually when walking. I'm not sure where I should be at 5 weeks post surgery. I see the Dr. in about 4 days.",0,1,Levator Ani Syndrone
10,2,NO,"Fri, May  27 '16 at 11:35AM EDT",swanee,"Dear Zoe,

It sounds like you would be better off not to do the Kegels, since that is aggravating the pelvic area.  I hope you have tried using replaceable pads in your underwear (briefs only), such as Depend Guards (or other brands as well).  I had a radical prostatectomy in 2002 and have had some incontinence ever since, even though the surgeon tried to spare my nerves.  When you have a prostatectomy you lose one of the two sphincters on the bladder outlet that shuts off the flow of urine when not urinating. This leaves you with just the sphincter that is at the base of the bladder to hold back the urine.  Experts say it can take up to a year after the operation before you get incontinence under control, and there will be 5% or so that never do without the aid of other devices.

I have had to use male guard pads in my briefs ever since 2002. My incontinence was due to the same cause as yours: STRESS incontinence, meaning it came about through activity, as you mention happens when you walk.  If I sit and read, I do not leak much. From 2002 to 2005 my leakage amounted to about 2 pads per day.  At that point I had to have a back operation, and before the operation began they couldn't insert the catheter so they had a urologist come to the hospital and enlarge my bladder opening.  Following that operation, my incontinence increased to 4-5 pads a day.  After putting up with that for a few years I decided to get an Artificial Sphincter installed, to see if I could get nearly dry.  The surgeon who did the installation had not done enough of these operations to be expert at it, and he cut my urethra, and so one month later he had to remove all the hardware he had so patiently installed.  Since 2010 I have used male guards in my briefs, not wanting to have any more operations to reduce the flow. (The other option would have been the male Advance Sling operation, which is for men with less than 4-5 pads per day use.) (If you ever decide to get an artificial sphincter or Advance Sling installed, BE SURE to find a surgeon who does many of these operation each year - not 2 or 3.)

If you have used pads and don't like that method of retention, there are several male condoms that can be used which catch the urine in a bag or reservoir on your leg. They go by the names of Bioderm, Afex, and Liberty 3.0. You can Google info on them.

There are other things that can aggravate your incontinence, like what you eat or drink, and when you drink. Also keep your bowels moving easily, since straining can weaken the pelvic floor.

It is interesting that some men can live with using 2-3 pads per day and not be bothered by it, while others just can't stand it and must have either a sling or artificial sphincter installed. We are all different. 

Hope this helps.

I have a history of prostate problems - multiple infections as a 20-40 year old; a TURP at age 50 for enlarged prostate; prostate cancer at age 61 (I had successful high dose rate brachytherapy). Last Fall I started to have persistent bleeding when I urinated. Shortly afterwards I developed symptoms of a prostate infection, so I went to a Urologist (I recently moved so I had to find a new doctor). In addition to having prostatitis, a cystoscopy confirmed that I had developed several large calcium stones in the prostatic urethra and bladder neck. In early January the doctor recommended, and performed, another cystoscopy where a Holmium laser was used to break-up the stones, and then he did a TURP to ""clean-up"" the necrotic tissue left over from my prior cancer radiation treatment.

While the doctor did say that my healing would be slow due to the elongated healing time for previously radiated tissue, he said the procedure was a success, and I should have a complete recovery. Well...here I am a little over 4 months later, and while most of the immediate symptoms (bleeding, passing blood clots, pain upon urinating, etc) have cleared up, I am still experiencing very persistent incontinence issues. At night I sleep in Depends Fit-Flex diapers, but I don't have any problems at all while sleeping. During the day, however, I go thru 2 Depend Maximum Guard inserts. Mostly it seems I have a constant dripping of urine, which goes undetected by me until I look at my pad during the day. By the end of the day the dripping seems to pick up significantly. The incontinence is better than the days immediately following my procedure, but I told my doctor at this pace it'll be another 10 years before things are normal. After a few recent discussions he has been careful not to predict any specific outcome, only to say if things are not better by mid-June he will do another cystoscopy to see what is actually going on.

I have read online where some doctors suggest the recovery time for someone with a prior TURP and also dealing with prior radiation may be upwards to a year. At this point I am not so much concerned about the timeline, but that I will have a 100% recovery. BTW, I have never had any issues with incontinence during any of my prior problems (ie. infections, TURP, cancer treatment), nor at any other time in my life.

quote=andy1050]Howdy,

I'd like to know about your experiences with mail order
incontinence companies and how their prodcts have been delivered to you.

Specifically, the way these products might be seen and identified by others.

Have you had your mail order incontinence supplies arrive at your home or mail pick up point with the contents clearly ID'd?

It's happened to me twice (not often, I admit), so that's why I'm asking.

Nothing like a case or two of adult diapers marked 'Six Dozen
Incontenence Briefs' or 'DEPENDS Adult Undergarments' in large letters printed on the shipping container.  Worst of all, it's
on your doorstep when you arrive home.  Maybe it's a named company specializing in catheters, for example, with a quantity and product listed on the wrapper: e.g., Male Urinary Catheters + size + quantity in bold print...and you have to walk away from the mail room with it in hand.  Ugh! 

What have you done when this happened?  Do not most companies advertise discreet shipping using unlabeled, unmarked boxes and wrappers as a courtesy to their customers?  Or, is this an extra cost service from some mail order businesses where the standard (default) shipment arrives in the manufacturer labeled boxes or packing? 

What are your feelings on this?  Embarrassment?  Or, isn't it even a concern for you?

I usually use a product like Attends poly or waistband briefs and I am constantly searching for the best price. Walmart, of all places , usually has the best price and I will get cases from them and they are not discreet. Having dealt with incontinence for so long I have learned that it doesn't really matter if someone sees the box although I understand peoples reservations.

 On a side note... Walmart has outstanding prices on some products but you must use the Walmart Online to get most stuff.

16,7,NO,"Wed, Jul  6 '16 at 7:54AM EDT",jaredc3,"Hi Jaytee. There are LOTS of us out there!   I too used to think I must be the only adult guy wetting his bed, or at least one of very few--joined perhaps only by people with severe physical or cognitive disabilities. But there are WAY MORE of us than just about anyone knows, and normal in every other way. I expect that the reason we think we're so unique is partly because most of us don't talk about it. We don't want anyone else to know. And the end result of that is that we feel alone and have no idea that we probably know several adult guys that wet the bed--but they don't talk about it either!

I'm not suggesting that we start advertising to the world that we wet our beds, but I take comfort in knowing that I'm part of a huge club. And if all of the other bedwetters in my circle of friends manage to live normal lives without others finding out (including me), that means I can too.

I once read a study that concluded that about 4% of college students and graduate students wet the bed at least once a week, and not due to the effects of alcohol. And considering that many adult bedwetters won't even admit it on an anonymous survey, that's a huge number! That's at least 1 in 25, not 1 in 50,000. And lots of other studies show that the incidence of bedwetting doesn't change much after age 18. So we can extrapolate that that rate likely carries on into adult years beyond college.

I'm NOT saying that there is no hope--that things won't improve for you or for any particular person here. But I feel empowered knowing that there are lots of others just like us. You likely know SEVERAL adult bedwetters--but you just don't know who they are.

I went that route today as I had a trip to the urologist today for a cystoscopy. I place the pad without removing the sheet over the adhesive.  The pad still stays in place that way.  I had removing the sheet, but the adhesive would tend to damage the Depend pull-ons.

Most days, I use and external catheter with a leg bag and I find that to be much better for me.  I use the a silicone pad from Coloplast WITHOUT aloe.  I had tried the ones with aloe, and they  left an awful gummy residue.  Some nights, it would take me 30 to 45 minutes to remove the condom and clean up.

I use a leg bag and tube from Hollister that connects directly to the condom.  I roll the condom catheter on the penis, and then connect it to the tube.  The Hollister bag has wide straps that stay in place betweent the knee and the ankle.  I can wear it from when I get up in the morning until I go to bed at night. I've been using one of these bags for about 30 days before changing, and after several months, have had no infection problem.  I do use a bit of alcohol to clean the end that attaches to the condom.

To drain the bag, I just to to a toilet, raise the seat and place the foot with the bag on the porcelain, and flip down the lever on the bag to drain it in 10-15 seconds.  The valve sits right above my ankle, so its a convenient location.

We have always protected our son by keeping him home from overnight activities, but finally decided this was not fair. He went to camp for the first time a month ago, 8 hours away from home, for a whole week. I sent him with extra sheets and plenty of clothes. When he came home, I didn't ask him if he had any accidents, I just threw everything in the wash. Since camp, he has gone on other over night activities and is enjoying being with other people.

I guess we're hoping that everything will just fall in place as he matures.....Advice?",0,1,Managing the emotional aspect of incontinence

I was put on Imipramine for IBS, which it didn't help, but found that my bladder felt much stronger as a side effect. Imipramine is an antidepressant that is also prescribed to treat bedwetting. It's an older antidepressant, and a high dose is toxic. I didn't like the way it made me feel if I took multiple pills every day, but I would take a half a pill to one and a half pills on nights that I felt like I might wet the bed, and that really helped. 

I'm 21 now and I did apparently ""grow out of it"" once I got married. The urologists always told me that the brain, including it's bladder control, does not fully mature until mid 20s.

I work at a Residential Care Facility, we specialize in clients who have failed placement at other facilities due to behavior issues.  I have a client in his 60's, he is big and burly with a deep booming voice.  This client refuses to sit on the toilet to have a bowel movement, the caregivers use a sit to stand to stand him up as he also refuses to stand.  He will yell at the care givers, call them names, curse at them and demand he be changed.  As soon as the CG's get him up in the sit to stand, get his depends and pants down he will defecate on the floor in his room, CG's will clean him up, get him back in his chair or bed and he will demand to be changed again doing the same thing. He refuses to sit on the toilet or let them change him over the toilet or even in the bathroom.  I have advised them at this point to verbally disengage from him.  To clean him up the best they can then explain to him that they will return when he can treat them with respect and can comply with care.  It is so hard for them to sit there and clean him up while he is cursing at them, calling them names etc.  He is not unaware of his actions, he will purposefully do this.

Please take the time, NOW, and review the thread. You clearly have NOT worked with difficult people before. READ the description of what this fellow's behavior has been. I'm not saying he should be ill-treated; what I would say is that the caregivers should be better treated. I have worked with people who were physically disabled who behaved this way, (though not to this extreme)and eventually their  behavior disqualified them for the care we were providing. This guy may not have had the ability to know what he was doing, but that does not obligate ANYONE to provide the care he requires. Behavior is learned and can be unlearned. Management strategies that work and that many times are needed, including sedation are better than not receiving care at all. 
If you don't have the mental capacity to handle this big bad world, please don't try shaming others for what you don't know how to cope with.",1,1,Need Advice-Willful fecal incontinence

We cannot sedate him or chemically/physically restrain him. We can give PRN anxiety meds if other redirections or interventions fail, if he has an order for it. 
I believe when he came to us he was on such high doses of anti psychotic medications he was a zombie and it made him want to eat and sleep 24/7 so med management team titrated him off. He does sleep and eat less now so it was obviously for sedation 
A little of his H&P- he was homeless and a meth user for many years, I am thinking he is used to not using the toilet because he didn't have one while he was homeless, 2nd, I think he may associate getting well with being discharged and back out on the street. 
I have informed staff to tell him when he starts yelling ""I am happy to help you when you stop yelling and go in to the bathroom, then verbally disengage. 
As far as the willful fecal incontinence, I am at a loss. He does have some early onset of dementia.

I find it helpful to really think about needs. What need is the behavior fulfilling. It looks like you have some ideas, anxiety about leaving the facility. It may be helpful to find an alternative means of changing him, and finding out what he wants for himself. Overall I would reccomend start by helping feel supported, safe, and accepted.

That includes ability to make his own choices about his medical and mental health treatment. Just because he has used meth does not make him a bad person. I've worked with numerous people with meth in the past,  many of them are good people not dangerous at all. Their lives are tragic but not bad people. Sedation is taking away peoples human rights. If he is not safe for the home, he will probably be moved to a higher level of care, however, just because he had struggles does not mean that he is different then the other people in the home.  Overall I think the best approach would be stabilizing his mental health as much as possible before focusing on the incontinence. Even though this is an inconvience for the staff.

It may be impossible to  take care of him right like staff want to but staff can be very cruel in their handling of patients. I am 82 but worked maintenance in a nursing facility and have seen some very bad care. The pay in nursing homes is so low the workers are angry and some take it out on patients and some are just lazy. I seen 1 nurse that got caught stuffing very strong paper towels into the butt so they don't have to clean so much and make more beds then when their shift is over the pull the towel and turn their patient over to the next nurse. When you find a concientous nurse their patients are lucky and show it. If you cannot talk or have no family to keep an eye out for nurses who will use every trick of the trade to make it easier for themselves or administrators who want bigger profits from medicare recipients. If a patient cant talk for themselves they end up with a feeding tube even if they can feed themselves OK. It is too hard for nurses to hand feed their patients sometimes and food is picked up and some never ate. That is the reason for weighing every week. Well I got that off my chest and I feel better.

Welcome to the forum.

It has been necessary for me to wear a diaper 24/7/365 for about 30 years now. I'm retired now, but my career involved working at a university where ""business casual"" is the typical attire for staff. When I first started wearing 24/7, I was concerned about people noticing. However, nobody ever said anything about it ever. One very important thing for me was convincing myself that in principle wearing a diaper is not different than using eyeglasses, a hearing aid or a cane. Diapers are just a way of managing a medical condition. And if anybody notices, they will likely understand that you have a medical problem.",3,2,New Guy

Typcally Depend brand makes ""pullups"" or ""pull-on style underwear"" or ""protective underwear"" all terms to describe a pull on. (They do make a ""fitted brief"" aka ""tab style"" or ""tape on diapers"" aka ""a diaper&quot The pullups are light duty protection, though have the most discretion. But obviously nothing is discreet after it leaks and soaks your pants for all to see. So unless you have really light leakage, most of us recommend the more robust protection afforded by a regular ""tape on style"" or ""tab style"" or ""fitted brief"" aka a diaper. There are a bunch of different terms because nobody wants to come right out and call them pullups and diapers. That's our PC world.

As PBJ said, There are diapers and pull-ups. There are also pads but that's another topic. As far as the tab-style products, there is no difference between Depends and adult diapers. Depends ARE adult diapers. They are just one of a great many companies that make them. Although adequate for some, they are by far not the best. There are many many more out on the market with far better comfort, absorbency, durability, discreetness, fit, thickness, etc.  I have tried literally dozens and have found several varieties that work well for me.

To be honest it takes a bit of trying various varieties to find what fits best and works best for you. Depends on your size & shape, type & amount of incontinence, activity level, day or night, etc. I like the Forsite AM/PMs & Confifry 24/7s best. They are a bit thick but thankfully super absorbent which sadly I need because although I do still have some control, I unfortunately often have massive flooding accidents both day & night.

My other consideration was that I really didn't have a choice because when I have an accident, it is almost always massive floods. Without a quality diaper I'd be saturating my clothes all the time and that to me is unacceptable so I am forced to pay more. I still wear the cheaper and more widely available brands but mostly when I'm at home or know that I'll be ok with the lighter protection.

Since bladder incontinence is not new to me, I can appreciate the thinking related to so many of the comments in the above thread.  

The situation is that I've long been confronted with so many of the finer points to keeping dry, the economics of it, and the daily management.  It has been a lot to work through over the years, but the personal processes of those more newly incontinent echo mine and remind me how I felt at the time, too.  There are stages to this, as you might well guess. 

Flooding and soaking is nothing new to me and coming to terms with it took patience and time.  It basically comes down to an accommodation.  You'll find it happening with yourselves and you'll see it evolving in others.  As you come here to participate or to simply just read, logging on here will become an important process that helps you cope: to return to or continue with you life activities and interests.

So, if it comes to concerns over floods, here we are!  If it comes to further concerns over being out and about in a wet or soaked diaper, here we are, too.

It so bugged me at first when I'd have an accident.  I felt totally compelled to escape and get into dry protection at once.  The impracticality (often the impossibility) of that forced a drastic re-think and new accommodation for me.  It works out like that; you re-invent and deal.  There is a lot of trial and error along the way.  The more resourceful you are, the better.

Sometimes this can occur as short a time as an hour after I've last been awake during the night to urinate.

Somehow, during these experiences, the kidneys apparently get a signal to markedly step up production, and in no small way.

When I awaken, my night clothes and a urine pad are soaked and then when I get to the toilet to urinate, I seem to pee yet another quart.  It's a lot.  Much, much more than I observe during a normal daytime or middle-of-the night urination.

Sometimes, this will occur a couple of nights in a row, and then everything is normal for periods of up to two months.

Some of the medical websites I've searched list up to 150 causes for this.

My primary care physician offered to prescribe an anti-diuretic hormone for this, but I decided against until I know what I'm dealing with.

Yes, I know I can see a urologist who will order test after test and often come up with no answer.

Thanks to Iconninmiss for the for the explanation as to how the physiology works.  My doctor had offered to give me a prescription for an antidiuretic drug to take before bedtime, but I declined.  I've learned through life's lessons not to take any drug unless I know exactly what it does and what possible side effects can result.

I've also learned that someone can undergo test after test and never come up with the underlying cause for a disorder.  Best example:  IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) When the doctors can't put their finger on what's causing a gastro problem, and after inumerable tests, they tell you that you have IBS.  I'm of the opinion that I'd get the same result if I submitted myself to the doctors on this bedwetting issue.

I started noticing frequent and urgent urination about 2 years ago, but in the last 2 months it has become worse and much more apparent to other people (friends, coworkers).  I also feel irritation in my urethra which is new (anyone else have this?).  Since it has worsened, I think I have started obsessing on my OAB which of course is only making it worse.  I feel like all I do is think about my OAB and the bathroom.

I'm fairly young, 39, so my friends and family simply do not understand my problem and I often get teased about it (and it does hurt my feelings because they don't see it as a real ""problem"" ), but they have no idea how badly it is affecting my life. The constant worry about an unexpected urge or always thinking about the bathroom when making plans or being stuck in long meetings (unfortunately I have a TON of them for my job) and having to excuse yourself 2-3 times for the bathroom while no one else has left the room once.  It is embarrassing!

I'm already an anxious person which makes the OAB a vicious cycle and I'm getting depressed thinking about how my bladder is in total control of my life.  I think about not being able to travel anymore (I took a trip to NYC last month and it was nightmare!) or even have the kind of social life I desire...I'm still single so I cringe at the thought of going on a date that I'll miss because I'll be in the bathroom half the date.  I know I need to stop this kind of thinking, but I don't know how!

I started some herbal supplements about 3 weeks ago and so far no improvement from that. I also started acupuncture just last week as I've read quite a few articles stating this could be the best thing to help OAB. She recommended I start bladder training in addition so I've been doing that as well.  I have also been doing kegel exercises, but half the time I don't know if I'm doing them right.  Can anyone tell me that they've had success with bladder training???

Sorry this turned into kind of a rant, but I have no one who understands or can empathize and it's clear folks here can and do.  Thank you for this site and for anyone who took the time to read this!",1,1,OAB driving me crazy!
31,2,NO,"Thu, Mar  31 '16 at 9:13PM EDT",kenedmunds,"Keiko,
First of all, the number of women living with OAB numbers in the MILLIONS. You are NOT alone. In the U.S., it is still a condition stigmatized, forcing anyone living with OAB into a covert sufferer status. I do think that there are quite a few things you can do to combat it. The bladder training, trite as it may sound, does help. Kegels can also contribute to more control. Staying away from caffeine, dark beverages in general, and trying to empty your bladder at all times when it IS convenient (and not so obvious) can all help.
Consulting a urologist is never a bad move. It can only help. Unfortunately, sometimes, at least in the beginning, taking some precautions from a product standpoint is necessary. I always urge people to make this their last option and also not to give up on regaining continence.

This survey is designed to collect questions from both people who suffer from incontinence, as well as those who care for someone with incontinence. The first question asks if you have incontinence. If you answer yes, it will then begin asking questions about yourself. If you answer no, it will ask you if you know someone who does suffer from incontinence, and go from there to ask about your experience caring for them.

Sorry for any confusion! I assure you that this is not a joke. Feel free to try again if you'd like to answer from a caregivers perspective.

As a part of our ongoing dedication to research and treatment options, we are currently working with an organization to learn more about OAB patients and their experience with OAB through an online survey. As you may know, OAB affects millions of people in the US. Symptoms include an urgent, and often frequent need to use the bathroom. OAB can occur with or without bladder leakage. 


We’re looking for: 

1.	Women who have tried in the past, or are currently using Botox, Interstim, UrgentPC, or NURO System for Overactive Bladder Symptoms. 

OR

2.	Women who currently see a gynecologist, OBGYN, or Uro-Gynecologist to treat symptoms of overactive bladder, irrespective of what treatments you may have tried. 

If you answered yes to either of the above questions, please consider signing up for this survey to share your experience. Eligible patients will receive compensation for their time upon survey completion.

Gleason 6, from what I've read is almost not even considered ""cancer"" as it's unknown if it even has the ability to turn into a higher grade metastatic disease.  But the jury is still out on that so I'd be wanting 100% confirmation of what I'm dealing with and then make an informed treatment decision.  Sometimes Gleason 6 exists along with nearby higher grade cancer.  Your doctor might be curious to see if there is more and or different cancer in another area of the prostate.  Needle cytology (biopsy) can tell exactly what kind of cancer it is, and what grade it is.  MRI can usually only tell that there is a mass present but can't tell exactly what it is. 

All your questions need to be asked to an oncologist, not an internet message board.

My 2nd biopsy the following year resulted in 10 cores of 12 being affected, rather than 2 only in 2014. I opted for Da Vinci robotic surgery and glad I did because they found some microscopic cancer in my seminal vesicles too in the path report (T-3b).My post-op PSA was 0.07, and then 0.09, but increased to 0.12 within a year.

  I have a question about a friend of mine. She has two boys (ages 8 and 9) who suffer from bedwetting. She has tried various treatments without success and has decided to have them wear protection to bed. They wet very heavily at night and have leaked through the pull-on style garments she's tried. I suggested she try pin-on style cloth diapers covered with a pair of plastic pants, or ""rubber pants"" as they're called by many people(I'm a 47 year old male who wets the bed and I've found that pin-on style cloth diapers and plastic pants are marvelous for keeping the bed dry) and she decided to purchase some.

 I was told by several customer service reps from companies that sell pin-on diapers for older children, teenagers, and adults that children in that age group may need assistance diapering themselves. Speaking personally,even as an adult I've found that it can be a little tricky pinning my diaper on and I realize that in some cases incontinent adults need help diapering themselves, so I suppose that the boys may need help too. The boys don't have cognitive or physical disabilities that would preclude them from diapering themselves, nevertheless I was told that their mother may need to help fasten their diapers. I understand that as children get older they become more skittish about their parents and older siblings being involved in these matters, but at the same time I feel it's important for the diapers to be secured correctly to get a good fit and prevent the diapers from leaking and soaking their beds. One customer service rep said that children their age may not have the dexterity to handle the safety pins correctly. 

  I also realize that there's a safety issue to consider - you don't want the boys accidentally sticking themselves with the safety pins. As mentioned she's tried other forms of protection and feels that pin-on diapers are the way to go. Have other people here on this forum dealt with a similar situation and if so how have you resolved it? Personally, I feel that even though they may be considered a little old for their mother to be involved in this task, if done in a loving and supportive manner it shouldn't be too much cause for concern. One way I thought might make it easier on everyone concerned is to have the boys fold and layer the diapers around themselves, then when they're ready for the safety pins to be put on have them call their mother in to do the pinning.",0,1,Question about bedwetting children

One issue is that boys that age are not famous for cleanliness; however, cleanliness is absolutely essential to incontinence management.  A flaming diaper rash is the last thing any parent wants for their older child.  The boys need to be taught to become competent to diaper themselves, to lubricate the pins by sticking them into a bar of soap, to fold and pin their protection so that it does its job, and to check that no stray bits of fabric poke outside their waterproof pants, to wick moisture onto the sheets.

My experience is with female bedwetting which usually clears at puberty ( as often does the male)but sometimes continues in lesser form after puberty

It appears the cause may be looseness in the front ligaments.Often there are problems also during the day. These problems in females we seem to correct with a midurethral sling well, well after puberty if the problem persists.

One issue is that boys that age are not famous for cleanliness; however, cleanliness is absolutely essential to incontinence management.  A flaming diaper rash is the last thing any parent wants for their older child.  The boys need to be taught to become competent to diaper themselves, to lubricate the pins by sticking them into a bar of soap, to fold and pin their protection so that it does its job, and to check that no stray bits of fabric poke outside their waterproof pants, to wick moisture onto the sheets.

  Thanks for the suggestions. I agree that the boys eventually need to be independent in this area. Until they do however do you think it's okay that the mother help out in some way?

(I actually wear that to bed now after bedwetting has returned, and I agree with everything everyone said above regarding cloth and plastic pants being the best protection for bedwetting).

My parents helped me put on my diapers until about age 8 or 9, when I took over the job.  I remember that it was hard at first, but my parents expressed confidence in my ability to learn this skill. Perhaps it sounds a bit odd, but to be honest I felt more grown up and mature, and more in control, by being able to pin on my own diapers. 

There were learning opportunities along the way, like seeing what happens if I don't get them on quite right (leaks), or how to lubricate the pins (we actually ran the pins through our hair just before pinning as hair oil kinda helped lube the pins too), and checking to make sure all of the cloth was within the plastic pants. I remember even sticking myself with the pins once or twice, and while not fun it was an important part of the learning process. 

I think that while it is appropriate for a parent to diaper their child at first, the underlying message could be that the child will be taking over responsibility for that job soon enough. The first several times the child does it, perhaps it will be under the supervision of mom or dad, but once parents are convinced that the child is relatively capable of doing it, the independence and accomplishment (not to mention the discretion) that comes with being able to take care of ones own diapering needs can be a big confidence boost.",0,1,Question about bedwetting children

I was told I could unpin one side of my diaper to pee if I had to in the morning, but to pin it right back on until I was checked. Of course it was never necessary to unpin as the diaper was already wet so I'd just pee in it if I needed to.

I have been struggling with incontinence for about six years now, i am 39 right now.  I Have mild Cerebral Palsy, which i think contributes to my problems.  The doctor's are not really sure what causes it, meds help some, but i still need a night diaper. They also tend to leave me exhausted so i choose to not do meds.  In general i wet at night, with sporadic mild to moderate day time problems.  Typically it is not much of a problem as long as use the restroom hourly, which works well with my job.  Occasionally i will go through periods of days to two weeks, where  my bladder is leaking like crazy.  High urgency and loss of control.  I use daytime diapers during those time.  Me and my doctor think they are muscle spasms, which come and go with other parts of my body as well.  It is definitely impacted by sleep and stress as well.  
So back to my question.  I first started to have this problem after a bladder infection moved into my prostate.  This caused mild wetting, but it intensified over the next several months.  I know i was running intensely at the time 3-4 miles a day.  I broke the routine when the weather got cold, and haven't really gotten a new routine started until recently.  Right now i am running about 1 mile a day. I experience mild stress leakage during this time, which i expect, but i am finding that for the two to three hours following the workout i am having incredible urgency, I have to use the bathroom every 20 minutes and frequently don't make it.  But after the two to three hours everything seems fine.  Has anyone ever experienced something similar.

An artificial sphincter (AMS 800) would be possible if I could get the strictures under control long enough, but several attempts (dilation, urethrotomy, ) have failed.  I traveled to other cities and even California to see if surgical experts can do something with no success.  I've spent about $10 K out of pocket for incontinence supplies, and my fruitless trips to doctors trying to find a way out.

I had no issues with incontinence after my first TURP, back in 2001, but have been dealing with serious incontinence issues since my second one this past January. I did a lot of research, and what I learned was during a TURP the INTERNAL urethral sphincter is removed, but the EXTERNAL urethral sphincter should not be affected (and you definitely need to confirm with your urologist that your external sphincter is still intact). Since it is a muscle it can be rehabbed/retrained.

I have been doing a 10-week rehab program developed by a physical therapist, Vanita Gaglani. This is a very complete and comprehensive program (not just doing Kegels, but much broader in scope)that Vanita outlined in a book she wrote, Life After Prostatectomy and Other Urological Surgeries. I just completed my 10th week recently, and I am vastly improved. If it hadn't been for a prostate infection I developed during the program I believe I would be only needing a light pad at this point. Also, one of the after-effects of radiation treatment is that the ""good"" tissue left behind doesn't heal as easily as ""normal"" tissue would, so whatever damage was done to my external sphincter during the second TURP is naturally going to take longer to heal. I am planning to go have a personal consultation with Vanita (we both live in Florida) to see what she recommends to get me 100% cured.

I encourage you to get her book and give her program a go. As I mentioned, it involves diet and lifestyle changes, focused breathing, a focus on strengthening the entire midsection, and a log you maintain to help document your progress.

An artificial sphincter (AMS 800) would be possible if I could get the strictures under control long enough, but several attempts (dilation, urethrotomy, ) have failed.  I traveled to other cities and even California to see if surgical experts can do something with no success.  I've spent about $10 K out of pocket for incontinence supplies, and my fruitless trips to doctors trying to find a way out.  

I also served a year in Nam, 65-66 in 6th Bn, 71st Arty (Hawk).

Im new to here. I came accross this site trying to do some research to help someome very close to me that i am a carer for. This 31 yr old woman is riddled with health issues which invove a prolapsed disk in her back and also has high levels of anxiety and depression aswell as bowel issues to which we arent quite sure of the diagnosis. At night, unknown to her she is loosing control of her bladder. It does not waken her at all she is completely unaware until the a.m. 
Im deeply concerned abt her bc she has so much already to deal with and this is making all her other problems worse. She takes some meds inc. Lyrica  (pregablin) for which she blames on this, vensir (an SSRI) and diazepam for her back problem, but just 2 pills a day its a low dose.

First. Thank you for doing what you do. Caring for someone with medical issues is so hard. You are doing an amazing thing. 
Second. Giant out exactly what she is taking. Then get on goigle and do some research. Medication is VERY subjective to the individual body. Certain chemical reaction can do one thing in one persona DM something completely different in another. 
For example. Celebrex had no history of making someone tired. It's just a special antiinflamitory but for me I was exhausted and didn't sleep well. For my mother in law it changed her life. See what I mean? 
Talk to your friend/client. Find out what it was she added recently. Could be diet, meds, or a combination. Meds could also be causing a lack of something she needs. 
After you figure that out she MUST tell a doctor. They need to know because whatever it is causing it could be causing permanent damage.

I think you are on the right track with trying some new products at home to find a solution that first of all works, and then adapted to work in the camp environment.  Given that pullups with backup still seem to be failing, I think it might be time to try a diaper style product.  I know from my own experience, that there does come a point where the voids are just too heavy for a pullup and diapers (while maybe a scary thought) are more adjustable, for a better fit.

The Tranquility ATN mentioned above are a good choice especially given they come in a wider size range than many other manufacturers. I believe thay may also have samples available to try.

It has been a few months since my last post. Fortunately I had a time where my symptoms seemed to be getting better (never fully went away, but they were manageable). However, now it seems as if the incontinence has come back in full force. I wet the bed last night and the last few days have been really tough staying dry.

A google search tells me that this could be my prostate, but seeing as how I'm only in my late 20's I would not think that to be the problem. Also when I have gone to the urologist in the past, they have told me that my prostate is fine. My question is, is it possible these two things are related (the hesitancy and the leaking)? I'm noticing that it's becoming increasingly difficult to feel like I've gotta go pee until right before I'm about to have an emergency.

Her theory is that this long experience is being ""relived"" and that somehow I have subconsciously reverted to that earlier stage when I had no control over my nightly wetting.  I don't think I agree with this theory and am more inclined to believe that my renewed bedwetting is simply an all new medical condition - not a psychological or emotional one - that has been exacerbated by the medication I am on.

Obviously, this theory having just been proposed to me by a friend who is not a professional counselor for such matters, I will likely bring this up when I do speak with someone more qualified.  But that being said I would like to know if anyone here has ever heard of such a theory and/or had any personal experience with this particular situation; i.e., former teen bedwetting and now current adult bedwetting.  Is there a link?

EDIT:  I should have added this.  My friend's theory is that when I was a bedwetter as a kid I was devastated, emotionally, by a feeling that I had no control over my wetting and, by extension, over my life.  That much is true I guess; I did feel like that.  Now in my present situation I have, for the first time in my adult life, found myself in a situation over which I also feel I have no control.  Also true, but I find it hard to believe that I would start wetting the bed again because of this rather than because of my medical and medication situation.",0,1,Teen enuresis and adult bedwetting?
31,2,NO,"Thu, Aug  10 '17 at 10:46AM EDT",Bobby103,"I don't believe you are reliving your past intentionally. It is just a repeat of a condition that you once endured. Like falling and skinning your knees. It happened in the past and can happen again.
There is evidence that youthful bed wetters will have more prevalence of sexual disorders and bladder issues in older age. This seems natural to me, as we may have had physical developmental issues, with certain areas of our body.
I myself wet the bed as a child and throughout my life have had to go much more frequently than others,perhaps just an inherent weakness. Now have night time problems at an older age.Almost expected if you look at research. But once again it might not be true for all.  Take precautions as you have in the past and get the BEST treatment for your prostate condition.",0,1,Teen enuresis and adult bedwetting?
16,3,NO,"Thu, Aug  10 '17 at 11:55AM EDT",jaredc3,"Like Bobby said, I have seen some data showing that those of us that were late bedwetters as kids or teens have a much higher likelihood of being bedwetters as adults than those who were dry at night at a typical age.  However, I don't think this necessarily has anything to do with psychological stuff.  It could just be that the same physical factors that contributed to your wetting as a kid/teen simply have been managed in the years since then, but they continue to exist.  For example, maybe you learned how to manage fluid intake so that your bladder could handle a full night, etc. (Not saying that these are the reasons for you in particular), but the underlying physical issues that caused the wetting (maybe deep sleep? relatively smaller bladder?  ADH production?) are still present.  And with a medical situation and the stress that comes with it, perhaps temporarily your learned management skills are somewhat overwhelmed such that you're wetting again.  Temporarily.  

BUT, I think it is just as likely that the bedwetting now is related to your BPH (prostate enlargement can lead to bedwetting), the meds you are taking, or even the stress of your current condition, regardless of whether you were a bedwetter as a kid.  I think those of us that were bedwetters as kids have both and advantage and a disadvantage if we experience bedwetting as adults.  The advantage is that we have been through this before and know many ways to deal with it or manage it.  The disadvantage being, especially for those that were humiliated, shamed, or punished for bedwetting, that all of those negative memories, emotions, and thoughts can come flooding back.  

There is NOTHING to be ashamed of.  You are experiencing something outside of your control and it is medical.  LOTS and LOTS of us experience similar things.  And it doesn't mean that you've lost any progress you made as a kid to conquer your bedwetting.  I agree with Bobby.  Get the best medical care you can.

In my teens I became a lost corse and a laughing stock at my high school.Bullied at home from my mum and at school lead to low self a steam and no confidence with low grades  I had not much of a future.

103,5,NO,"Tue, Sep  20 '16 at 4:07PM EDT",MikeJames,"I started wetting the bed as an adult...we'll I wet once or twice a year my whole life so it was hardly a problem. Over the last year I developed overactive bladder and wet just about every night now. Maybe one dry night out of 10 or more.  

It's been very hard on me as well. I started soaking the bed with my wife sleeping with me. I had to keep waking her up to tell her we needed to strip the bed. I had loads of daily laundry to do. I dealt that with this for a while before realizing hey you know know what?  You need diapers!  That realization was enlightening because it forced me to really recognize my problem. It was damning because it dumped a new level of embarrassment on me.  When I came home with diapers and showed them to my wife i was so mortified.  But she was SO supportive and agreed it was a good idea. Wearing them the first night with her in bed was very hard on me. But waking up the next morning in a dry bed and wet diaper was so much better!  Over the months I've gotten used to wearing them. I sleep so much better now.

In the meantime I saw a urologist and went through the battery of invasive tests. I was diagnosed with OAB and given pills.  The pills at best shaved a wet night or two off per week but for me had unbearable side effects. I saw no point in taking pills that didn't completely resolve my wetting. I now accept that I need to wear diapers to bed.  It's not something I enjoy but it's such a relief to come to that acceptance. It really has not impacted intimacy with the wife. We just work around it..

We've gone on overnight stays out of state at her friends house and I just packed my diapers. I was very nervous about wetting their bed so I put very heavy booster pads in my already very heavy diapers (I wear abena L4, Seni Quatro, or Northshore Supremes) and had no problem on that trip.  I wet my diaper both nights but our friends bed was dry.  I also put absorbant disposable bed pads down but didn't even need them.  We just packed the wet diapers up in plastic and took them back home with us.  No one knew. There no reason you cant sleep away from home!  Just use adequate protection.  When in doubt, wear MORE than you even think you need. You'll have peace of mind 

I also bought leakmaster PUL pullup diaper to wear over everything. These are like plastic pants but with absorbant material.  Trust me, an Abena level 4, abri let maxi, and these PUL diapers, nothing will leak.  It's a lot of bulk to sleep in but who cares?

If you wet a lot during the day, get good high end diapers and you'll be fine.  Personally I'm  not even a candidate for surgery yet but I'd rather wear diapers than get major surgery.  These surgeries often have serious negative results and to me a diaper is a better choice. Good luck.",0,1,They said I would grow out of it 27 years on

Seems we are split on the issue.  That's understandable.

Over time, I've found this topic come up and with nearly
the same results each time.

It boils down to personal preference.  We each must determine
what works best; what we need, what we want, what we feel most comfortable using.  Knowing one's own level of incontinence and daily patterns is essential, too.  In time, we learn those patterns and to manage them in response.

There are lots of choices in adult diaper brands and how to combine many of the incontinence products (pad/booster/cover)
for personal requirements. We all play the trial and error game to find what's best FOR US.

Here, it's important to learn, to share and to give support.

I had an interstim from Medtronic implanted in October 2013.  It worked fine.  In May 2014 I had a SCS implanted.  I was assured they would not ""fight"" with each other.

Our next step was Botox injections.  I got a second opinion from another urology specialist and they agreed it might help me.  I was unable to get it done as I needed a hip replacement - there was no way I could be in stirrups.  After two years of specialists I had a hip replacement last month.

I'm sorry to hear about that issue you described. I hate to recommend that anyone wear an incontinence product unless it is absolutely necessary. I think incontinence products should be the last resort when all other options have been explored and weren't successful.
In terms of trying to avoid wearing any products, one method would be to start limiting your fluid intake just after dinner. Throughout the day it is important to stay hydrated, but you can start to taper off after dinner. Of course trying to empty your bladder right before bedtime is always a good idea too. 
I also think it would be wise to see your doctor and explain your symptoms. He/She may be able to suggest another course of action (perhaps medicine or some type of physical therapy) that might have an effect on those symptoms.
If none of that helps, I think we would then have to start looking at what disposable incontinence products would best suit your specific needs. Perhaps you could experiment with different products on those nights where you were not able to empty your bladder before you went to bed.
Let me know if you want to talk about specific products and I'll gladly lend a hand.

I am a 49 year old man that started having urgency after an incident of pneumonia that caused brain damage because of the lack of oxygen to my brain. All the ""urological"" causes have been ruled out so they are chalking it up to ""neurological"" causes. I have been diagnosed with neurogenic bladder. Detrol controlled the urges for years. When it stopped working they changed it to oxybutinyn which worked for about a year. Then the urges came back but this time I was incontinent with the urges. That is when I started seeing a urologist. They have tried me on multiple drugs, trospium then Myrbetriq. Since I started the Myrbetriq I went from wetting my pants one or maybe two times a day at most to wetting every few hours. Clearly it is not working. My frustration is I have had to resort to wearing diapers-which I hate-but I can't find a brand that doesn't leak! How do other men handle ""large-volume"" incontinence. The testing showed when I was incontinent it was with 800cc's or more in my bladder. That is an ocean! What can I wear that doesn't leak until, hopefully, I regain my continence.

Is there anything I can do to prevent it from happening? I never just allow my bladder to empty into my diaper- when I am losing urine, I am still trying my best to hold it in.

76,2,NO,"Thu, Jan  5 '17 at 3:59PM EST",inconninmiss,"As I understand it, the medical term ""urinary retention"" refers to not being able to empty your bladder completely even when you try to do so. What you're doing thus doesn't fit the medical definition of urinary retention because you can fully empty your bladder when you try to do so in a toilet.

Your description of your incontinence makes it sound as if it's what's called ""urge incontinence."" You get strong feelings that you need to urinate and start leaking urine if you don't get to the toilet fast enough. I have had the same condition for most of my life. For me at least, trying to stop the flow once I've begun to leak uncontrollably is painful; and the more I try to stop the leaking the more it hurts. So when the situation arises, I just allow my bladder to empty into my diaper. In my opinion, that's what a diaper is for.

My strategy to reduce the frequency of involuntary urine loss is to use the bathroom at least once every couple of hour during the day. In other words, I try not to let my bladder fill to the point where an uncontrollable ""urge"" occurs.",0,1,Urinary retention
46,3,NO,"Thu, Jan  5 '17 at 5:06PM EST",dougsbc,"I actually have urge incontinence and retention. They treated me for years for urge incontinence without success. When they finally did a full urological evaluation my problem is I went years delaying trips to the bathroom because of work conditions. Sometimes I would go 12-16 hours without a trip. Toward the end of those long hours I would feel a lot of pressure but no sudden urges or urine losses. I managed (without realizing it)to ""stretch"" out my bladder. So when my incontinence did start, I was pretty confused but the conclusion of the work up is that I retain my urine without sensation until my bladder fills. During testing the sensation doesn't start until I have 1200 mls in my bladder. The sensation is an over powering urge I can't control and lose an entire liter of urine in my pants which explains why I only void 2-3 times a day weather voluntarily or not. But if you are suffering from incontinence, you won't ""develop"" a retention problem unless it already exists. The only thing you are doing by trying to ""hold"" even when you are leaking is delaying the inevitable and suffering with a bunch of frustration. You don't mention what the cause of your incontinence is, but if it is urge incontinence, if frequent ""toileting"" doesn't help, you are probably going to wet your pants and not be able to do a thing about it. Because of my huge volume voids, I have to pad up with multiple booster pads and a huge plastic diaper otherwise they leak terribly. I do have the Interstim device now which has helped a bit, and frequent trips to the bathroom don't work for me because if there is no sensation, I can't release. I have started cathing if I need to guarantee staying dry for a long period of time and that works. But if I don't cath, I just have to put up with the flooded jeans and briefs. I know this is awfully frustrating but I am only 50 years old and all I can do is try to accept it. I hope something in this long story helps.",0,1,Urinary retention
28,4,NO,"Sat, Feb  4 '17 at 3:22PM EST",Jay,"Not being a doctor please take this all with a grain of salt.  My case is complicated like yours and yes...  You can have OAB and bladder retention.   In my case urinating normally I would void something like 150ml from a bladder that is smallish.   Mine is 250ml when its at the explosion stage according to a urodynamics test.   A 1200ml bladder like yours is... WOW.   Amazing.  

So in my case over active bladder is simple.   When it takes 150ml to top off an always half full bladder you go to the bathroom a LOT. 

So I do two things.   I self Cath (Sounds awful its not) and empty the entire bladder.   Retaining urine all the time is not healthy (Repeating what I was told)  It leads to UTI and Kidney infections etc.  OUCH.   I also take an OAB drug so that my smallist bladder is not still making me void 16 times a day or whatever.   Its more like 6 or 7 which I think is fairly normal.   

Two things to consider and maybe test drive.   First even tho it sounds like a horror show give self cathing a try.  After some practice its pretty much a non topic.   Coloplast makes a nice pocket one called speedi cath.  They will send samples if your doctor prescribes them.   Another one to try that I like is this new place http://www.compactcath.com/  These are smaller thus nothing poking up out of your pocket.   Both are self lubed so no fooling around you just do it.

For the OAB stuff maybe consider this drug Myrbetriq.  I tried some older ones first but didn't have much luck.  I'm not sure how Canada does new meds or Caths.   Someone suggested they wanted patients to reuse caths which... sounds scary.  

Oh!  One last word of wisdom (Or possibly dumbness)  Use BZT wipes if you cath.   Some doctors talk about it others seem to pass over that.  If NOTHING else wash your hands before.  UTIs are a bitch.   And thankfully I've never had one from Cathing.",0,1,Urinary retention

I am a 68 y/o Vietnam Veteran, 25th Infantry Division, with 10 years total service.  My last duty assignment was as an Instructor at the BT Center at Fort Dix and I have, since leaving active duty, kept myself in pretty decent physical condition with very few serious health problems over my lifetime.  Until now.

At a recent VA annual physical exam my PSA count was 21.53 - way beyond normal range - and a DRE determined that my prostate was very enlarged and has at least one lump in one quadrant so I have been scheduled for a TRUS biopsy at the VA Hospital in Providence, RI in a couple of weeks.  In the interim I have been prescribed Tamsulosin which, among other things, has an infrequent but somewhat embarrassing side effect:  occasional bed wetting.  After the first time this happened I - reluctantly - bought a bag of Depend Flex-Fit pull-ups and wear one to bed ""just in case"".  They suck (can I say ""suck"" here?) and if I wet heavily they tend to leak possibly because I tend to move around a lot at night.

Anyway, until I receive a pathology report with the Gleason Score and Staging information, I cannot say for certain that I have prostate cancer or, if I do, what the treatment will be.  I do understand though, from the VA's site, MyHealtheVet, that the majority of Agent Orange (dioxin) related prostate cancers are aggressive and may require surgical removal of the gland, resulting in a higher likelihood of urinary incontinence than what I am currently experiencing.

So - the question - if the Flex-Fit pull-ups I am currently using for occasional bed wetting are only marginally useful, what can I expect from the VA with respect to adult diapers if incontinence becomes a 24/7 problem? (I buy the product on my own right now since my situation won't be classified as a service related disability until and unless a clear cancer diagnosis is determined.)

Cyanogen Chloride, and trichloromethane are especially problematic byproducts of uric acid and chlorine reacting.  In fact, these compounds are primarily responsible for the typical pool chlorine odor, and the reason pool water burns your eyes.  A clean pool, with just chlorine, has very little chemical odor.  

It's also worth noting that sweat contains a fair bit of uric acid as well, so it's not like peeing in the pool is the only source.

4,24,NO,"Thu, Feb  4 '16 at 9:30PM EST",dedevz,"So there is very little mention of medical testing done here. Have you had a catheter put in and test the size of your bladder? Have you had the pressure checked in your bladder? Also, have you had x-rays done of your spine? If you have a tiny separation in your spine...it's like a spinabifida that has gone unnoticed,and that can cause bladder problems. It took forever for someone to do proper testing on our daughter. No pediatric doctor would test her....but finally, when she was 16, she saw a new doctor who did all the tests. She had very high pressure. She can become totally incontinent when she is 30 unless they try some proceedures. One is injecting botox into the bladder. Since she is a senior in high school, if the botox overworks, she may have had to cath herself to go to the bathroom. The doctor has had great success with botox, every 6 months. One other thing is the pacemaker for the bladder. Our daughter had that done and immediately she stopped wetting.Then after 3 weeks, it stopped working, UGH....we think the wires that are near her spine, moved..she is very skinny and the nerves are close together. We've switched programs often and sometimes it works, but while she's experimenting, she still wears a diaper. So , we wait. We know that is DID work...so we think it may work again, if the wiring is changed. We'll see. Good luck to all of you but find a docor who will test you, work with you. One daughter had lots of infections, so the doctors did tons of testing on her when she was 4 or 5. We adopted her from an orphanage, so we knew nothing of her medical history. It turned out she had reflux, which could lead to kidney failure. The surgery was a success. Findingout the purpose of bedwetting is very important.",0,1,Wetting

Good luck with your daughter.  I have had all the urological tests and six bladder/urethral surgeries, including several Botox shots.  My last surgery was a urinary sphincterotomy.

I had no idea it was an option. My daughter heard about it and wanted to try it so badly....so we went for it. I know that they have done lots of them at Duke, and we might go there and get another opinion....although the doctor who did my daughters is sort of a relative, and we really adore here. We'll just have to wait and see. The surgery isn't difficult. She hardly took a pain pill.

The Botox injections worked pretty much as advertised.  They quieted my bladder spasms and paralyzed the sphincter.  However, they wore off after successively shorter periods of time.  The first shots lasted some six months; the second shots lasted perhaps four months, and, when the last series of shots lasted less than six weeks, my urologist decided that a sphincterotomy was my last, best hope for a long-term cure.  It was, and I have never regretted having it.  I am incontinent, with no hope of ever regaining control, which I was told to expect.  However, my kidneys are no longer threatened; my bladder spasms continue, but the pain is greatly reduced, and diapers enable me to live a nearly normal life.  Only my family and close friends and neighbors know.  I hope that the pacemaker will solve your daughter's incontinence.",0,1,Wetting

Because she didn't like me, when she found out I wear adult diapers, she broadcasted it to the school, student body and other parents. It's crazy what a 12 year old will do and say to be mean and disrespectful. She did try to spin it as me being into something weird and her parents even reported me to the principle. 
She told her orients I was looking at word things and naked people on my computer with them in the classroom. (Never have at any time) 
I had to meet with the principle, superintendent and school board to explain myself. When I refused to in front of a gym full of parents I was threatened with firing from the school board. The administration was very supportive and explained to the school board president what all this was. After that the school board came to my defense. I was not happy having everyone know of my medical issues, but in the end it created more understanding and exposed this student for the bully and problem she was. 
Now I teach regardless of students knowing about it or not. I have even had a few students that struggle with incontinence talk to me about it. Even helped a girl talk to her parents about it. 
Point is, it was degrading, embarrassing and depressing what I went through. But on the other side of it now, it has now have helped so many and created a culture of understanding in our small community.",5,1,When someone knows that shouldn't

4,9,NO,"Thu, Jun  2 '16 at 9:58PM EDT",RRRN,"As others have said, I guess I see this as something that's pretty personal and would be disclosed at the same point in a relationship where you were comfortable telling someone intimate life details like awkward sexual experiences, total number of sexual partners, life altering episodes of fecal incontinence (as in a pool, school or restaurant had to be shut down and you moved away afterwards), any prescription medication you are taking or past medical history. Some people, even those who are married, never get to the point where any of those conversations come up in their lifetimes, and that's ok. Less can definitely be more. Do we really need to KNOW everything about each other's most intimate personal habits? In other words, if it comes up, it comes up. Don't hide it, but don't offer it randomly either. If it comes up, discuss it normally, because it is normal, for you. Unless it's contagious or illegal I don't feel any of these things are part of normal disclosure. I guess as a woman my opinion is different because we're used to hiding our ""feminine products"" for life? Do you feel the need to tell a partner if you have a preference for pads vs tampons when you have your period? Exactly! 

We're adults and if we have external fluid challenges, or urinary incontinence, we wear pads or disposable undergarments. Presentation and correct terminology is everything. You are in control of perception. To me, referring to ""diapers"" or ""pee"" would only be appropriate when discussing babies, not adults.

  The stoma is the surgical hole. A thin tube with a balloon at the end then goes down into the bladder.

I wear a pad all the time.  These are available in many shapes and sizes.  In mine, the absorbent part is about 50cm. in length and 18cm. wide, widening to 24cm at the front and back.  Inside are two elasticated expanding pockets about 2.5cm.deep 18cm. apart extending the whole length of the absorbent area to prevent spillage.  The absorbent area is surrounded by a strong margin 1.5cm. wide for gripping to adjust the position of the pad.

The pad is held in place by net fixation pants.  These are similar for both sexes.  There is no front exit.  I rarely pass urine through the normal route - occasionally just a small amount which is soaked up by the pad.  I have faecal leakage only occasionally, most usually immediately after a bowel evacuation which has not fully emptied my bowel.  Because the legs tend to be tight, I buy a size larger than what it says on the packet which are usually by measurement around the widest part of the hips.  Perhaps the top of the leg would be a better measure.
  
My pad is normally changed each day, as part of getting up.  The pads cost £10 - £11 for a pack of 34 and the pants 40p to £1 each depending on the brand and quantity bought.  They are washable and last about a month each.",0,1,Your best tips and advice
103,10,NO,"Mon, Sep  18 '17 at 3:52PM EDT",MikeJames,"First tip I'd give is to call your doctor and get checked out.  Maybe it can be cured.

If you're stuck living with it though, like many of us the best tip I can give is to get good protection.  go online and buy the premium diapers.  they're worth it in spades.

Secondly I'd advise to be confident.  Even a bulky diaper isn't obvious under normal clothing.  A leak is more embarrassing than a thick diaper.  Trust me.  Lastly, change regularly.  I could probably get 10 hours out of my chosen diaper, but I never push it past 5-6 hours (other than when sleeping).  I do this to not only to almost completely negate the risk of a leak, but also as importantly, to clean my skin and let it air dry for a few moments.  the importance of skin care CANNOT be understated.",1,1,Your best tips and advice

I am a 53 year old woman. I suffer from occasional nighttime incontinence. I don't know if this happens to anyone else but I always dream I am urinating and, because of past experiences, I try to confirm (in my dream), that I am, in fact, sitting on the toilet. Used to be that I was able to figure out (while still asleep)that I was dreaming, and not 'let go'. Now however, I somehow convince myself that it is OK to 'let go ', with the unpleasant results.
I have been extremely stressed recently and the problem certainly seems to be worse at the moment. I went to the doctor once, many years ago, but no help or even possible causes discussed.
The odd thing about my stress is that it was at it's worst about 8 months ago but I wasn't experiencing incontinence then - perhaps I was in shock.
Anyway, I'm wondering if anyone else has the dream thing going on and if so, if you've found a way to manage it?",0,1,

Don't worry about it, you are not the only one that has had this happen, count me in the bunch too! :-( Stress can do very peculiar things to the human body!  This was before my accident that it happened, 3-4 times in 10 years or so as I recall, now I have to wear protection at night, so if it happens I have it covered, a good mattress protector is a must for sure if it is re-occurring, and some form of containment if it occurs could be useful, there are a ton of disposable and re-useable washable waterproof products out there today, and as I say, Better Safe Then Sorry!
